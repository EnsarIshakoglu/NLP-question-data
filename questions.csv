0,java,"Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior. For some strange reason, sorting the data (before the timed region) miraculously makes the loop almost six times faster.
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {   // Primary loop
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum = &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; '\n';
}


Without std::sort(data, data + arraySize);, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.
With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.

(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)

Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {   // Primary loop
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }
}

With a similar but less extreme result.

My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated.

What is going on?
Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?

The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.

Related / followup Q&amp;As about the same effect with different / later compilers and options:

Why is processing an unsorted array the same speed as processing a sorted array with modern x86-64 clang?

58,git,"I have a repo (origin) on a USB key that I cloned on my hard drive (local). I moved ""origin"" to a NAS and successfully tested cloning it from here.

I would like to know if I can change the URI of ""origin"" in the settings of ""local"" so it will now pull from the NAS, and not from the USB key.

For now, I can see two solutions:


push everything to the usb-orign, and copy it to the NAS again (implies a lot of work due to new commits to nas-origin);
add a new remote to ""local"" and delete the old one (I fear I'll break my history).

This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list.
Why is this?
It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.¹
The main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it's easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual.
Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow does support special characters. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. [php] &quot;==&quot; vs &quot;===&quot;

I would assume this is to prevent people from doing an eval() on it, but all you'd really have to do is replace the while and then you'd be set. I would assume the eval prevention is to make sure people write safe JSON parsing code.

I've seen this used in a couple of other places, too, but a lot more so with Google (Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.) Strangely enough, Google Docs starts with &amp;&amp;&amp;START&amp;&amp;&amp; instead, and Google Contacts seems to start with while(1); &amp;&amp;&amp;START&amp;&amp;&amp;.

And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting glaringly obvious factual errors and promoting abysmally bad programming styles.
Please edit the accepted answer to provide quality books and an approximate skill level — preferably after discussing your addition in the C++ chat room. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from.

As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.

Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).

So, the question is basically:

Given a pile of n pairs of socks, containing 2n elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)

I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:


A general theoretical solution for a huge number of socks.
The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)

111,regex,"Over the years I have slowly developed a regular expression that validates most email addresses correctly, assuming they don't use an IP address as the server part.

113,git,"Does anybody know how to easily undo a git rebase?

The only way that comes to mind is to go at it manually:


git checkout the commit parent to both of the branches 
then create a temp branch from there
cherry-pick all commits by hand
replace the branch in which I rebased by the manually-created branch


In my current situation this is gonna work because I can easily spot commits from both branches (one was my stuff, the other was my colleague's stuff).

However my approach strikes me as suboptimal and error-prone (let's say I had just rebased with 2 of my own branches).

Any ideas?

167,c,"Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.
Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.
The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. &quot;Use a transaction!&quot;), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:

A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto
My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.
The code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as &quot;Release&quot; with &quot;Full Optimization&quot; (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).
I'm using the SQLite &quot;Amalgamation&quot;, compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).

Let's write some code!
The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this &quot;baseline&quot; version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:
/*************************************************************

The &quot;Control&quot;
Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.

Imported 864913 records in 0.94
seconds

Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)

The &quot;Worst-Case-Scenario&quot;
We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:
sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')&quot;, sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?

Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
seconds

Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second.
Using a Transaction
By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 38.03
seconds

That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.
Using a Prepared Statement
Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:
/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)&quot;);
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\t&quot;);   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Version */

Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF
By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 12.41
seconds

The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second.
PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 13.50
seconds

A little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 12.00
seconds

Fantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second.
Using an In-Memory Database
Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:
#define DATABASE &quot;:memory:&quot;


Imported 864913 records in 10.94

It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.
Refactoring C Code
Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical

A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.

Summary (so far)
I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!

CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX
Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:
Create Index then Insert Data
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
...

Insert Data then Create Index
...
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 13.66
seconds

As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.

I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.

A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it &quot;a dramatic design flaw&quot; of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)
Edit:
Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:
&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print(&quot;a executed&quot;)
...     return []
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x=a()):

...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]

To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or &quot;together&quot; with it?
Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be &quot;hybrid&quot; in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.
The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.

219,javascript,"I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.

I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work.  Should they? 

Here's my code:

var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}

// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);

// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');

console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);


The console output is

typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]


It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.

I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.

I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???)  

Is there an easy workaround?



Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12111. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.

226,flash,"I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.

Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:

var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!


We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.

I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.

Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.

I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?

git clone followed by removing the .git repository directory.
git checkout-index alludes to this functionality but starts with &quot;Just read the desired tree into the index...&quot; which I'm not entirely sure how to do.
git-export is a third-party script that essentially does a git clone into a temporary location followed by rsync --exclude='.git' into the final destination.

None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to svn export might be option 1, because both require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.

For example, the following function is O(n) because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input n:

f(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)

Similarly, if there was a nested loop, the time would be O(n2).

My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:  

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 


B: 

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test


I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.

Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?

The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML



#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */

The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?

Update:

Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

Update 2:

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

Compiled on Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 with full optimization and SSE2 enabled for 32-bit on a Intel Core 2 Duo (x64), the first example takes 5.5 seconds and the double-loop example takes only 1.9 seconds.
Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):

movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]

Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0

Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:

    &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.
Using JavaScript:
&lt;button onclick=&quot;window.location.href='/page2'&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and style it to look like a button.
&lt;a href=&quot;/link/to/page2&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt;

This question is different from ""How to get the IP address of the docker host from inside a docker container"" due to the fact that the IP address of the docker host could be the public IP or the private IP in the network which may or may not be reachable from within the docker container (I mean public IP if hosted at AWS or something).

One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call pow(a,2) by compiling it into a*a, but the call pow(a,6) is not optimized and will actually call the library function pow, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, Intel C++ Compiler, executable icc, will eliminate the library call for pow(a,6).) 

What I am curious about is that when I replaced pow(a,6) with a*a*a*a*a*a using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4"", it uses 5 mulsd instructions:

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13


while if I write (a*a*a)*(a*a*a), it will produce

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm13, %xmm13

378,java,"In Java, arrays don't override toString(), so if you try to print one directly, you get the className + '@' + the hex of the hashCode of the array, as defined by Object.toString():

384,php,"Let me prefix this by saying that I know what foreach is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with foreach"".



For a long time I assumed that foreach worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a copy of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.

Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:

$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


Test case 1:

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */


This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:

Test case 2:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */


This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. But...

If we look in the manual, we find this statement:


  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.


Right... this seems to suggest that foreach relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're not working with the source array, right? Well, not entirely.

Test case 3:

// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [""value""]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [0]=&gt;
    int(0)
    [""key""]=&gt;
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/


So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then test case 1 would loop forever.

The PHP manual also states:


  As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.


Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).

Test case 4:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


Test case 5:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.



The Question

What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.

It seems to me that foreach works with a copy of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.


Is this correct and the whole story?
If not, what is it really doing?
Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (each(), reset() et al.) during a foreach could affect the outcome of the loop?

Tiny benchmark addendum and recap

Implementation
Lines per second

"
437,gruntjs,"I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:


npm &amp; bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.


Questions:


What is webpack &amp; webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

447,algorithm,"I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.

One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.

My current algorithm:

while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}


What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.

But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?

67,c,"Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.
Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.
The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. &quot;Use a transaction!&quot;), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:

A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto
My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.
The code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as &quot;Release&quot; with &quot;Full Optimization&quot; (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).
I'm using the SQLite &quot;Amalgamation&quot;, compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).

Let's write some code!
The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this &quot;baseline&quot; version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:
/*************************************************************

Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.

Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)

The &quot;Worst-Case-Scenario&quot;
We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:
sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')&quot;, sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?

Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
seconds

Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second.
Using a Transaction
By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 38.03
seconds

That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.
Using a Prepared Statement
Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:
/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)&quot;);
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\t&quot;);   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;);        /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_step(stmt);

    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

printf(&quot;Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n&quot;, n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF
By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 12.41
seconds

The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second.
PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 13.50
seconds

A little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 12.00
seconds

Fantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second.
Using an In-Memory Database
Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:
#define DATABASE &quot;:memory:&quot;


Imported 864913 records in 10.94
seconds

It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.
Refactoring C Code
Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, &quot;\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical

Imported 864913 records in 8.94

A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.

Summary (so far)
I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!

CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX
Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:
Create Index then Insert Data
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
...

Insert Data then Create Index
...
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 13.66
seconds

As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.

I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.

A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it &quot;a dramatic design flaw&quot; of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)
Edit:
Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:
&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print(&quot;a executed&quot;)
...     return []
...

...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]

To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or &quot;together&quot; with it?
Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be &quot;hybrid&quot; in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.
The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.

I am trying to do authorization using JavaScript by connecting to the RESTful API built-in Flask. However, when I make the request, I get the following error:

XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://myApiUrl/login. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.

I know that the API or remote resource must set the header, but why did it work when I made the request via the Chrome extension Postman?
This is the request code:
$.ajax({
    type: &quot;POST&quot;,
    dataType: 'text',
    url: api,
    username: 'user',
    password: 'pass',
    crossDomain : true,

    .done(function( data ) {

119,javascript,"I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.

I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work.  Should they? 

Here's my code:

var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}

// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);

// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');

console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);


The console output is

typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]


It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.

I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.

I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???)  

Is there an easy workaround?



Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12111. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.

126,flash,"I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.

Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:

var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!


We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.

I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.

Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.

I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?

178,python,"It is my understanding that the range() function, which is actually an object type in Python 3, generates its contents on the fly, similar to a generator.
This being the case, I would have expected the following line to take an inordinate amount of time because, in order to determine whether 1 quadrillion is in the range, a quadrillion values would have to be generated:
1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)

Furthermore: it seems that no matter how many zeroes I add on, the calculation more or less takes the same amount of time (basically instantaneous).
I have also tried things like this, but the calculation is still almost instant:
1000000000000000000000 in range(0,1000000000000000000001,10) # count by tens

If I try to implement my own range function, the result is not so nice!!
def my_crappy_range(N):
    i = 0
    while i &lt; N:
        yield i
        i += 1
    return

What is the range() object doing under the hood that makes it so fast?

Martijn Pieters' answer was chosen for its completeness, but also see abarnert's first answer for a good discussion of what it means for range to be a full-fledged sequence in Python 3, and some information/warning regarding potential inconsistency for __contains__ function optimization across Python implementations. abarnert's other answer goes into some more detail and provides links for those interested in the history behind the optimization in Python 3 (and lack of optimization of xrange in Python 2). Answers by poke and by wim provide the relevant C source code and explanations for those who are interested.

git-export is a third-party script that essentially does a git clone into a temporary location followed by rsync --exclude='.git' into the final destination.

None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to svn export might be option 1, because both require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.

For example, the following function is O(n) because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input n:

f(int n) {
  int i;

git pull origin test

I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML



#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;

#content {

The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?

Update:

Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

Update 2:

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:

Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?

It might also be interesting to point out the differences between CPU/cache architectures, by providing a similar graph for these CPUs.

Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:

There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.
Using JavaScript:
&lt;button onclick=&quot;window.location.href='/page2'&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and style it to look like a button.
&lt;a href=&quot;/link/to/page2&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt;

This question is different from ""How to get the IP address of the docker host from inside a docker container"" due to the fact that the IP address of the docker host could be the public IP or the private IP in the network which may or may not be reachable from within the docker container (I mean public IP if hosted at AWS or something).

One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call pow(a,2) by compiling it into a*a, but the call pow(a,6) is not optimized and will actually call the library function pow, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, Intel C++ Compiler, executable icc, will eliminate the library call for pow(a,6).) 

What I am curious about is that when I replaced pow(a,6) with a*a*a*a*a*a using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4"", it uses 5 mulsd instructions:

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13


while if I write (a*a*a)*(a*a*a), it will produce

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm13, %xmm13


which reduces the number of multiply instructions to 3. icc has similar behavior.

is a command-line tool that can be run as a regular web server and lets one run JavaScript programs
utilizes the great V8 JavaScript engine
is very good when you need to do several things at the same time
is event-based so all the wonderful Ajax-like stuff can be done on the server side
lets us share code between the browser and the backend
lets us talk with MySQL

284,php,"Let me prefix this by saying that I know what foreach is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with foreach"".



For a long time I assumed that foreach worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a copy of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.

Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:

$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


Test case 1:

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */


This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:

Test case 2:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */


This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. But...

If we look in the manual, we find this statement:


  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.


Right... this seems to suggest that foreach relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're not working with the source array, right? Well, not entirely.

Test case 3:

// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [""value""]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [0]=&gt;
    int(0)
    [""key""]=&gt;
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/


So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then test case 1 would loop forever.

The PHP manual also states:


  As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.


Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).

Test case 4:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


Test case 5:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.



The Question

What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.

It seems to me that foreach works with a copy of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.


Is this correct and the whole story?
If not, what is it really doing?
Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (each(), reset() et al.) during a foreach could affect the outcome of the loop?

"
337,gruntjs,"I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:


npm &amp; bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.


Questions:


What is webpack &amp; webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

347,algorithm,"I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.

One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.

My current algorithm:

while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}


What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.

But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?

461,c++,"One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)

462,c#,"I know from reading the Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.

{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }


My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?

edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

"
466,c#,"When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

474,ios,"With the iOS SDK:
I have a UIView with UITextFields that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:

Allow scrolling of the contents of the UIScrollView to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up

Automatically &quot;jump&quot; (by scrolling up) or shortening


I know that I need a UIScrollView.  I've tried changing the class of my UIView to a UIScrollView, but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.
Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other?
What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?
Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.
Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal.

I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.
I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using:
-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
    scrollView.frame.size.width,
    scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   // Resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    // Keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.width,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); // Resize

testObject properties:

  two: 2
  three: 3

Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]


It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.

I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.

I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???)  

Is there an easy workaround?



Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12111. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.

26,flash,"I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.

Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:

var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!


We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.

I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.

Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.

I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?

95,git,"I've been wondering whether there is a good &quot;git export&quot; solution that creates a copy of a tree without the .git repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:

git clone followed by removing the .git repository directory.
git checkout-index alludes to this functionality but starts with &quot;Just read the desired tree into the index...&quot; which I'm not entirely sure how to do.
git-export is a third-party script that essentially does a git clone into a temporary location followed by rsync --exclude='.git' into the final destination.

None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to svn export might be option 1, because both require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.

This is wrong because it doesn't work if the file name contains multiple . characters. If, let's say, I have a.b.js, it will consider a and b.js, instead of a.b and js.

98,algorithm,"I am learning about Big O Notation running times and amortized times.

For example, the following function is O(n) because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input n:

f(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
    printf(""%d"", i);
}


Similarly, if there was a nested loop, the time would be O(n2).

There are several developers who either commit to master or create other branches and later merge into master.

Let's say work on test is taking several days and you want to continuously keep test updated with commits inside master.

I would do git pull origin master from test. 

Question 1: Is this the right approach?  Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.



My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:  

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 


B: 

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test


I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.

Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?

The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.

114,html,"I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML



#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
}
&lt;table id=""page""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;




The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?

Update:

Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

Update 2:

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

}

for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {

Compiled on Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 with full optimization and SSE2 enabled for 32-bit on a Intel Core 2 Duo (x64), the first example takes 5.5 seconds and the double-loop example takes only 1.9 seconds.
Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+20h],xmm0

movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]

Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]

movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+38h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+30h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+40h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+40h],xmm0

The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:

Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?

It might also be interesting to point out the differences between CPU/cache architectures, by providing a similar graph for these CPUs.

127,html,"I would like to create an HTML button that acts like a link. So, when you click the button, it redirects to a page. I would like it to be as accessible as possible.
I would also like it so there aren't any extra characters, or parameters in the URL.
How can I achieve this?

Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:
&lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;/page2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

but the problem with this is that in Safari and Internet Explorer, it adds a question mark character to the end of the URL. I need to find a solution that doesn't add any characters to the end of the URL.
There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.
Using JavaScript:
&lt;button onclick=&quot;window.location.href='/page2'&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and style it to look like a button.
&lt;a href=&quot;/link/to/page2&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt;

  JSONP is script tag injection, passing the response from the server in to a user specified function.


I can sort of understand that, but it's still not making any sense.



So what is JSONP? Why was it created (what problem does it solve)? And why would I use it?

This question is different from ""How to get the IP address of the docker host from inside a docker container"" due to the fact that the IP address of the docker host could be the public IP or the private IP in the network which may or may not be reachable from within the docker container (I mean public IP if hosted at AWS or something).

One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call pow(a,2) by compiling it into a*a, but the call pow(a,6) is not optimized and will actually call the library function pow, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, Intel C++ Compiler, executable icc, will eliminate the library call for pow(a,6).) 

What I am curious about is that when I replaced pow(a,6) with a*a*a*a*a*a using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4"", it uses 5 mulsd instructions:

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13


while if I write (a*a*a)*(a*a*a), it will produce

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm13, %xmm13


which reduces the number of multiply instructions to 3. icc has similar behavior.

Why do compilers not recognize this optimization trick?

184,php,"Let me prefix this by saying that I know what foreach is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with foreach"".



For a long time I assumed that foreach worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a copy of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.

Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:

$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


Test case 1:

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */


This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:

Test case 2:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */


This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. But...

If we look in the manual, we find this statement:


  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.


Right... this seems to suggest that foreach relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're not working with the source array, right? Well, not entirely.

Test case 3:

// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;

    [""value""]=&gt;

So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then test case 1 would loop forever.

The PHP manual also states:


  As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.


Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).

Test case 4:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


Test case 5:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.



The Question

What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.

It seems to me that foreach works with a copy of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.


Is this correct and the whole story?
If not, what is it really doing?
Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (each(), reset() et al.) during a foreach could affect the outcome of the loop?

Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards.

For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.

  different threads talk to the
  processor's memory.

Well, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.

Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.


Questions:


What is webpack &amp; webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

247,algorithm,"I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.

One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.

My current algorithm:

while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}


What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.

But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?

Ash recommended Date.parse for parsing date strings, which gives an authoritative way to check if the date string is valid.

Ash made me consider not having my API accept Date instances at all, this would be easiest to validate.

361,c++,"One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)
"
362,c#,"I know from reading the Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.

To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.

For example:

public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }


My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?

edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

366,c#,"When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points;
HTML2PDF and HTML2PS: I actually had better luck with this.  It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and

What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

    Process.GetCurrentProcess().PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime;

    long start = 0, stop = 0, elapsed = 0;
    double avg = 0.0;

    long temp = Fibo(1);

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; 100000000; i++)
    {

    }

    Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: "" + avg);

}

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
    {
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = fibo;
        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }

    return fibo;
}


On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try
    {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
        {
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = fibo;
            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.



UPDATE: It looks like this issue has been fixed by Roslyn. Same machine, same CLR version -- the issue remains as above when compiled with VS 2013, but the problem goes away when compiled with VS 2015.

"
498,c#,"When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:


  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:

var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();

  
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.


But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..

So then I think:


  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;, so I will inherit from it:

class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}



But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List&lt;T&gt;. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List&lt;T&gt; always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List&lt;T&gt; or not?

Question 1: Is this the right approach?  Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.



My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:  

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 


B: 

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test


I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.

Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?

The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.

14,html,"I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML



#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */

        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;




The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?

Update:

Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

Update 2:

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:

Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?

Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:

    &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.
Using JavaScript:
&lt;button onclick=&quot;window.location.href='/page2'&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and style it to look like a button.
&lt;a href=&quot;/link/to/page2&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt;

One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call pow(a,2) by compiling it into a*a, but the call pow(a,6) is not optimized and will actually call the library function pow, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, Intel C++ Compiler, executable icc, will eliminate the library call for pow(a,6).) 

What I am curious about is that when I replaced pow(a,6) with a*a*a*a*a*a using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4"", it uses 5 mulsd instructions:

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13


while if I write (a*a*a)*(a*a*a), it will produce

movapd  %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13
mulsd   %xmm13, %xmm13

HAVING COUNT(email) &gt; 1

So if we have a table
ID   NAME   EMAIL
1    John   asd@asd.com
2    Sam    asd@asd.com
3    Tom    asd@asd.com
4    Bob    bob@asd.com
5    Tom    asd@asd.com

This query will give us John, Sam, Tom, Tom because they all have the same email.
However, what I want is to get duplicates with the same email and name.
That is, I want to get &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Tom&quot;.
The reason I need this: I made a mistake, and allowed inserting duplicate name and email values. Now I need to remove/change the duplicates, so I need to find them first.

84,php,"Let me prefix this by saying that I know what foreach is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with foreach"".



For a long time I assumed that foreach worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a copy of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.

Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:

$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


Test case 1:

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */


This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:

Test case 2:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */


This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. But...

If we look in the manual, we find this statement:


  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.


Right... this seems to suggest that foreach relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're not working with the source array, right? Well, not entirely.

Test case 3:

// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [""value""]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [0]=&gt;
    int(0)
    [""key""]=&gt;
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/


So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then test case 1 would loop forever.

The PHP manual also states:


  As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.


Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).

Test case 4:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


Test case 5:

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.



The Question

What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.

It seems to me that foreach works with a copy of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.


Is this correct and the whole story?
If not, what is it really doing?
Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (each(), reset() et al.) during a foreach could affect the outcome of the loop?

"
137,gruntjs,"I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:


npm &amp; bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.


Questions:


What is webpack &amp; webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

147,algorithm,"I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.

One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.

My current algorithm:

while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}


What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.

But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?

261,c++,"One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)
"
262,c#,"I know from reading the Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.

To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.

For example:

public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }


My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?

edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

266,c#,"When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

274,ios,"With the iOS SDK:
I have a UIView with UITextFields that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:

Allow scrolling of the contents of the UIScrollView to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up

Automatically &quot;jump&quot; (by scrolling up) or shortening


I know that I need a UIScrollView.  I've tried changing the class of my UIView to a UIScrollView, but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.
Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other?
What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?
Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.
Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal.

I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.
I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using:
-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
    scrollView.frame.size.width,
    scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   // Resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    // Keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.width,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); // Resize

Is there a way I can use Git to either (a) sort the list of branches by latest commit, or (b) get a list of branches together with each one's last-commit date, in some kind of machine-readable format?

Worst case, I could always run git branch to get a list of all the branches, parse its output, and then git log -n 1 branchname --format=format:%ci for each one, to get each branch's commit date. But this will run on a Windows box, where spinning up a new process is relatively expensive, so launching the Git executable once per branch could get slow if there are a lot of branches.

What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

    long start = 0, stop = 0, elapsed = 0;

        elapsed = stop - start;
        avg = avg + ((double)elapsed - avg) / i;
    }

    Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: "" + avg);
    Console.ReadKey();
}

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
    {
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = fibo;
        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }

    return fibo;
}


On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try
    {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
        {
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = fibo;
            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.

"
398,c#,"When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:


  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:

var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();

  
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.


But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..

So then I think:


  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;, so I will inherit from it:

class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}



But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List&lt;T&gt;. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List&lt;T&gt; always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List&lt;T&gt; or not?

413,java,"I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer): 


I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt()
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.
Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
231.5 integers whose square is less than 263).


Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:

public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}


Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.



I've tried the different solutions to the problem:


After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.
The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.
Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.
A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().
Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.
According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.
I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being x megabytes where x is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.

The (absolutely crazy) results

I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):

g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test


Here are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running test 1 (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):


unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003&nbsp;GB/s


As you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):

clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test


Result: test 1


unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB/s


So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:

uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;


to

uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;


Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139&nbsp;GB/s


Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:


unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906&nbsp;GB/s


Wait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!

I asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.

More madness, please!

Take the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:

static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;


Here are my results in g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB/s


Yay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.

My question

Can you explain these results? Especially:


How can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?
How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?
How can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!


I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?

The Disassembly

Here is the disassembly for the various results:

Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?

Lessons learned

No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.

The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.

I don't want to go into the discussion about the smartness of throwing an exception or crashing an entire web application because somebody entered a character in a text box, but I am looking for an elegant way to handle this.

Trapping the exception and showing


  An error has occurred please go back and re-type your entire form again, but this time please do not use &lt;


doesn't seem professional enough to me.

Disabling post validation (validateRequest=""false"") will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks.

Ideally: When a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded.

426,python,"What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.

By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.

I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyError(""foo"")

It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.

I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.

Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.


After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?
An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

existence on (unencoded) binary data

I basically found no formal guidance on the web regarding the use of the different content-types so far.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.


  Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions.


Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.

486,sql,"Good Overviews
Generally speaking, you're making a decision between fast read times (for example, nested set) or fast write times (adjacency list). Usually, you end up with a combination of the options below that best fit your needs. The following provides some in-depth reading:

One more Nested Intervals vs. Adjacency List comparison: the best comparison of Adjacency List, Materialized Path, Nested Set, and Nested Interval I've found.
Models for hierarchical data: slides with good explanations of tradeoffs and example usage
Representing hierarchies in MySQL: very good overview of Nested Set in particular
Hierarchical data in RDBMSs: a most comprehensive and well-organized set of links I've seen, but not much in the way of explanation

Options
Ones I am aware of and general features:

Adjacency List:


Columns: ID, ParentID
Easy to implement.
Cheap node moves, inserts, and deletes.
Expensive to find the level, ancestry &amp; descendants, path
Avoid N+1 via Common Table Expressions in databases that support them


Nested Set (a.k.a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal)


Columns: Left, Right
Cheap ancestry, descendants
Very expensive O(n/2) moves, inserts, deletes due to volatile encoding


Bridge Table (a.k.a. Closure Table /w triggers)


Uses separate join table with ancestor, descendant, depth (optional)
Cheap ancestry and descendants
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Normalized encoding: good for RDBMS statistics &amp; query planner in joins
Requires multiple rows per node


Lineage Column (a.k.a. Materialized Path, Path Enumeration)


Column: lineage (e.g. /parent/child/grandchild/etc...)
Cheap descendants via prefix query (e.g. LEFT(lineage, #) = '/enumerated/path')
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Non-relational: relies on Array datatype or serialized string format


Nested Intervals


Like nested set, but with real/float/decimal so that the encoding isn't volatile (inexpensive move/insert/delete)
Has real/float/decimal representation/precision issues
Matrix encoding variant adds ancestor encoding (materialized path) for &quot;free&quot;, but with the added trickiness of linear algebra.


Flat Table


A modified Adjacency List that adds a Level and Rank (e.g. ordering) column to each record.
Cheap to iterate/paginate over
Expensive move and delete
Good Use: threaded discussion - forums / blog comments


Multiple lineage columns


Columns: one for each lineage level, refers to all the parents up to the root, levels down from the item's level are set to NULL
Cheap ancestors, descendants, level
Cheap insert, delete, move of the leaves
Expensive insert, delete, move of the internal nodes
Hard limit to how deep the hierarchy can be

Database Specific Notes
MySQL

Use session variables for Adjacency List

Oracle

Use CONNECT BY to traverse Adjacency Lists

PostgreSQL

ltree datatype for Materialized Path

SQL Server

General summary
2008 offers HierarchyId data type that appears to help with the Lineage Column approach and expand the depth that can be represented.

Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards.

For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.

Update: correct way
var obj = new Object(); // not a functional object
obj.prototype.test = function() { alert('Hello?'); }; // this is wrong!

function MyObject() {} // a first class functional object

22,c++,"C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?

This article (by Gavin Clarke who quotes Herb Sutter) says that,


  The memory model means that C++ code
  now has a standardized library to call
  regardless of who made the compiler
  and on what platform it's running.
  There's a standard way to control how
  different threads talk to the
  processor's memory.
  
  ""When you are talking about splitting
  [code] across different cores that's
  in the standard, we are talking about
  the memory model. We are going to
  optimize it without breaking the
  following assumptions people are going
  to make in the code,"" Sutter said.


Well, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.

C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.

I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?

As I don't know how the internals of multi-threading work, and what memory model means in general, please help me understand these concepts. :-)

"
37,gruntjs,"I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:


npm &amp; bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.


Questions:


What is webpack &amp; webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

47,algorithm,"I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.

One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.

My current algorithm:

while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}


What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.

But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?

70,git,"I have cloned a project that includes some .csproj files. I don't need/like my local csproj files being tracked by Git (or being brought up when creating a patch), but clearly they are needed in the project.

When I type git status, it shows my changes to csproj which I am not interested in keeping track of or submitting for patches.

  either by default (overrideModeDefault=""Deny""), or set explicitly by a

More detail can be found here, in Scenario 7 matches my hex error code.

The solution given on the linked site above is to set Allow for overrideModeDefault in the section mentioned in my error, in the applicationHost.config file.  In my case,  under Security in system.webServer.  But if I look at the applicationHost.config on my local computer, where the site is properly deployed already, that section is set to Deny.

If this solution is correct, how is my local instance running just fine with the same web.config?  According to my applicationHost.config, that section should be locked, but it's not.  I'd prefer to not change the applicationHost.config file, because there are many other sites running on that server.  Is there another solution?

Borgar suggested testing for a Date instance, and then testing for the Date's time value. If the date is invalid, the time value is NaN. I checked with ECMA-262 and this behavior is in the standard, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

The question is: How do people create placeholders in selectboxes? But it has already been answered, cheers.

And using this results in the selected value always being grey (even after selecting a real option):

161,c++,"One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)
"
162,c#,"I know from reading the Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.

To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.

For example:

public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }


My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?

edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

"
166,c#,"When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

174,ios,"With the iOS SDK:
I have a UIView with UITextFields that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:

Allow scrolling of the contents of the UIScrollView to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up

Automatically &quot;jump&quot; (by scrolling up) or shortening


I know that I need a UIScrollView.  I've tried changing the class of my UIView to a UIScrollView, but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.
Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other?
What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?
Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.
Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal.

I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.
I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using:
-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
    scrollView.frame.size.width,
    scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   // Resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    // Keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,

                                  scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); // Resize

203,php,"I have an HTML (not XHTML) document that renders fine in Firefox 3 and IE 7.  It uses fairly basic CSS to style it and renders fine in HTML.

I'm now after a way of converting it to PDF.  I have tried:


DOMPDF: it had huge problems with tables.  I factored out my large nested tables and it helped (before it was just consuming up to 128M of memory then dying--thats my limit on memory in php.ini) but it makes a complete mess of tables and doesn't seem to get images.  The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points;
HTML2PDF and HTML2PS: I actually had better luck with this.  It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and
Htmldoc: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.

Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

        avg = avg + ((double)elapsed - avg) / i;
    }

    Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: "" + avg);
    Console.ReadKey();
}

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
    {
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = fibo;
        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }

    return fibo;
}


On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try
    {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
        {
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = fibo;
            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.

"
298,c#,"When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:


  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:

var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();

  
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.


But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..

So then I think:


  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;, so I will inherit from it:

class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}



But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List&lt;T&gt;. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List&lt;T&gt; always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List&lt;T&gt; or not?

313,java,"I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer): 


I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt()
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.
Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
231.5 integers whose square is less than 263).


Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:

public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}


Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.



I've tried the different solutions to the problem:


After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.
The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.
Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.
A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().
Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.
According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.
I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being x megabytes where x is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.

The (absolutely crazy) results

I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):

g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test


Here are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running test 1 (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):


unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003&nbsp;GB/s


As you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):

clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test


Result: test 1


unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB/s


So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:

uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;


to

uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;


Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139&nbsp;GB/s


Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:


unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906&nbsp;GB/s


Wait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!

I asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.

More madness, please!

Take the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:

static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;


Here are my results in g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB/s


Yay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.

My question

Can you explain these results? Especially:


How can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?
How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?
How can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!


I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?

Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?

Lessons learned

No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.

The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.

It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.

I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.

My version of node is always v0.6.1-pre even after I install brew node and NVM install v0.6.19.

My node version is:

node -v

NVM says this (after I install a version of node for the first time in one bash terminal):

nvm ls
v0.6.19
current:    v0.6.19

nvm ls
v0.6.19
current:    v0.6.1-pre

So where is this phantom node 0.6.1-pre version and how can I get rid of it? I'm trying to install libraries via NPM so that I can work on a project.

I tried using BREW to update before NVM, using brew update and brew install node. 
I've tried deleting the ""node"" directory in my /usr/local/include and the ""node"" and ""node_modules"" in my /usr/local/lib.
I've tried uninstalling npm and reinstalling it following these instructions.

All of this because I was trying to update an older version of node to install the ""zipstream"" library. Now there's folders in my users directory, and the node version STILL isn't up to date, even though NVM says it's using 0.6.19.

Ideally, I'd like to uninstall nodejs, npm, and nvm, and just reinstall the entire thing from scratch on my system.

From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.

Interface:

Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.

Abstract Class:

Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.


After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?
An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

Options
Ones I am aware of and general features:

Adjacency List:


Columns: ID, ParentID
Easy to implement.
Cheap node moves, inserts, and deletes.
Expensive to find the level, ancestry &amp; descendants, path
Avoid N+1 via Common Table Expressions in databases that support them


Nested Set (a.k.a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal)


Columns: Left, Right
Cheap ancestry, descendants
Very expensive O(n/2) moves, inserts, deletes due to volatile encoding


Bridge Table (a.k.a. Closure Table /w triggers)


Uses separate join table with ancestor, descendant, depth (optional)
Cheap ancestry and descendants
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Normalized encoding: good for RDBMS statistics &amp; query planner in joins
Requires multiple rows per node


Lineage Column (a.k.a. Materialized Path, Path Enumeration)


Column: lineage (e.g. /parent/child/grandchild/etc...)
Cheap descendants via prefix query (e.g. LEFT(lineage, #) = '/enumerated/path')
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Non-relational: relies on Array datatype or serialized string format


Nested Intervals


Like nested set, but with real/float/decimal so that the encoding isn't volatile (inexpensive move/insert/delete)
Has real/float/decimal representation/precision issues
Matrix encoding variant adds ancestor encoding (materialized path) for &quot;free&quot;, but with the added trickiness of linear algebra.


Flat Table


A modified Adjacency List that adds a Level and Rank (e.g. ordering) column to each record.
Cheap to iterate/paginate over
Expensive move and delete
Good Use: threaded discussion - forums / blog comments


Multiple lineage columns


Columns: one for each lineage level, refers to all the parents up to the root, levels down from the item's level are set to NULL
Cheap ancestors, descendants, level
Cheap insert, delete, move of the leaves
Expensive insert, delete, move of the internal nodes
Hard limit to how deep the hierarchy can be

Database Specific Notes
MySQL

Use session variables for Adjacency List

Oracle

Use CONNECT BY to traverse Adjacency Lists

PostgreSQL

ltree datatype for Materialized Path

SQL Server

General summary
2008 offers HierarchyId data type that appears to help with the Lineage Column approach and expand the depth that can be represented.

I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.

One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:

agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]

which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -&gt; 0.91239
0.912300 -&gt; 0.9123

448,android,"I'm working on implementing a widget transparency option for my app widget although I'm having some trouble getting the hex color values right. Being completely new to hex color transparency I searched around a bit although I couldn't find a specific answer to my question. 

I want to set transparency by hex color so let's say my hex color id ""#33b5e5"" and I want it to be 50% transparent. Then I'll use ""#8033b5e5"" because 80 is 50%. 

I found a useful chart here: http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm . With this data I managed to come up with this:

0% = #00
10% = #16
20% = #32
30% = #48
40% = #64
50% = #80
60% = #96
70% = #112
80% = #128
90% = #144


Now the issues start appearing when I get higher than 100 in hex. Hex color codes can only be 8 symbols long right? For example #11233b5e5 (80%) crashes.

What can I do to enable me to use the higher numbers aswell?

The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to http://siteB, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests.


Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read Cross-origin resource sharing and attempted to read Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in w3c recommendation

If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?

This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do


Further articles/books on this topic:


What names do you find yourself prepending/appending to classes regularly? 
What’s the best approach to naming classes?
Book: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Hardcover)
Book: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Hardcover)
Book: Implementation Patterns (Paperback)


And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:


Coordinator
Builder
Writer
Reader
Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter
Controller
View
Factory
Entity
Bucket


And a good tip for the road:


  Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important   enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.

484,git,"I currently have three modified files in my working directory. However I want one of them to be reset to the HEAD status.

In SVN, I'd use svn revert &lt;filename&gt; (followed by svn update &lt;filename&gt; if needed) but in Git I should use git reset --hard. However this command cannot operate on a single file.

Is there any way in Git to discard the changes to a single file and overwrite it with a fresh HEAD copy?

487,security,"As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

I tried the following:

Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug information are set on all assemblies.
Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLL files related to the project from my entire machine.
Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch.
Reboot.

I have two Windows Forms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug information, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug information on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?

I want to add here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.

Ash recommended Date.parse for parsing date strings, which gives an authoritative way to check if the date string is valid.

Ash made me consider not having my API accept Date instances at all, this would be easiest to validate.
Borgar suggested testing for a Date instance, and then testing for the Date's time value. If the date is invalid, the time value is NaN. I checked with ECMA-262 and this behavior is in the standard, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

61,c++,"One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)
"
62,c#,"I know from reading the Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.

To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.

For example:

public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }


My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?

edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

"
66,c#,"When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

I have a UIView with UITextFields that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:

Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other?
What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?
Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.
Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal.

I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.
I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using:
-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,

89,css,"I'm currently designing a CSS 'mega dropdown' menu - basically a regular CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.

At the moment, it appears that CSS&nbsp;3 transitions don't apply to the 'display' property, i.e., you can't do any sort of transition from display: none to display: block (or any combination).

Is there a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to 'fade in' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?

I'm aware that you can use transitions on the visibility: property, but I can't think of a way to use that effectively.

I've also tried using height, but that just failed miserably.

I'm also aware that it's trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS, and I think I'm coming up a little short.

100,javascript,"When embedding JavaScript in an HTML document, where is the proper place to put the &lt;script&gt; tags and included JavaScript? I seem to recall that you are not supposed to place these in the &lt;head&gt; section, but placing at the beginning of the &lt;body&gt; section is bad, too, since the JavaScript will have to be parsed before the page is rendered completely (or something like that). This seems to leave the end of the &lt;body&gt; section as a logical place for &lt;script&gt; tags.

So, where is the right place to put the &lt;script&gt; tags?

DOMPDF: it had huge problems with tables.  I factored out my large nested tables and it helped (before it was just consuming up to 128M of memory then dying--thats my limit on memory in php.ini) but it makes a complete mess of tables and doesn't seem to get images.  The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points;
HTML2PDF and HTML2PS: I actually had better luck with this.  It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and
Htmldoc: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.

Example:

var long_string = 'some text not important. just garbage to' +

I tried doing something similar in Python, but it didn't work, so I used \ to split the long string. However, I'm not sure if this is the only/best/pythonicest way of doing it. It looks awkward.

Locally, I only have a master branch. Now I need to work on bug-fix-a, so I check it out, work on it, and push changes to the remote. Next I do the same with bug-fix-b.

What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;

        n2 = fibo;
        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }

    return fibo;

On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try

            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.

But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List&lt;T&gt;. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List&lt;T&gt; always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List&lt;T&gt; or not?

213,java,"I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer): 


I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt()
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.
Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
231.5 integers whose square is less than 263).


Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:

public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}


Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.



I've tried the different solutions to the problem:


After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.
The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.
Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.
A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().
Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.
According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.
I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being x megabytes where x is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.

The (absolutely crazy) results

I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):

g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test


Here are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running test 1 (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):


unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003&nbsp;GB/s


As you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):

clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test


Result: test 1


unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB/s


So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:

uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;


to

uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;


Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139&nbsp;GB/s


Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:


unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906&nbsp;GB/s


Wait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!

I asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.

More madness, please!

Take the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:

static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;


Here are my results in g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB/s


Yay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.

My question

Can you explain these results? Especially:


How can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?
How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?
How can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!


I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?

Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?

Lessons learned

No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.

The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.

225,asp.net,"Every time a user posts something containing &lt; or &gt; in a page in my web application, I get this exception thrown.

I don't want to go into the discussion about the smartness of throwing an exception or crashing an entire web application because somebody entered a character in a text box, but I am looking for an elegant way to handle this.

Trapping the exception and showing


  An error has occurred please go back and re-type your entire form again, but this time please do not use &lt;


doesn't seem professional enough to me.

Disabling post validation (validateRequest=""false"") will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks.

Ideally: When a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded.
So the .Text property of my text-box will be something &amp; lt; html &amp; gt;

Is there a way I can do this from a handler?

226,python,"What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.

By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.

I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyError(""foo"")
_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6


It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.

I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.

Update: two answers have suggested overriding __init__, and __str__/__unicode__/__repr__. That seems like a lot of typing, is it necessary?

  rejected Merge the remote changes before pushing again.  See the 'Note

I thought that probably a

would force my local copy to push changes to the remote one and make it the same. It does force the update, but when I go back to the remote repo and make a commit, I notice that the files contain outdated changes (ones that the main remote repo previously had).

My version of node is always v0.6.1-pre even after I install brew node and NVM install v0.6.19.

257,oop,"I have had recently two telephone interviews where I've been asked about the differences between an Interface and an Abstract class. I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.

From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.

Interface:

Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.

Abstract Class:

Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.


After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?
An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

I currently have a website with a body font-size of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16 pixels.

I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16 pixels whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full-blown widescreen desktop.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as well as having extra breakpoints, otherwise, I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100pixels decrease in width to control the text.

285,javascript,"I noticed that JavaScript's new Date() function is very smart in accepting dates in several formats.

Xmas95 = new Date(""20 09 2006,12:52:39"")


I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling new Date() function.

This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.


  Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions.


Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.

var d1 = new Date();
d1.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');       //Returns ""2009-06-29"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
d1.toString('dddd, MMMM ,yyyy')  //Returns ""Monday, June 29,2009"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome


Also here I couldn't find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string.

Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?

286,sql,"Good Overviews
Generally speaking, you're making a decision between fast read times (for example, nested set) or fast write times (adjacency list). Usually, you end up with a combination of the options below that best fit your needs. The following provides some in-depth reading:

One more Nested Intervals vs. Adjacency List comparison: the best comparison of Adjacency List, Materialized Path, Nested Set, and Nested Interval I've found.
Models for hierarchical data: slides with good explanations of tradeoffs and example usage
Representing hierarchies in MySQL: very good overview of Nested Set in particular
Hierarchical data in RDBMSs: a most comprehensive and well-organized set of links I've seen, but not much in the way of explanation

Options
Ones I am aware of and general features:

Adjacency List:


Columns: ID, ParentID
Easy to implement.
Cheap node moves, inserts, and deletes.
Expensive to find the level, ancestry &amp; descendants, path
Avoid N+1 via Common Table Expressions in databases that support them


Nested Set (a.k.a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal)


Columns: Left, Right
Cheap ancestry, descendants
Very expensive O(n/2) moves, inserts, deletes due to volatile encoding


Bridge Table (a.k.a. Closure Table /w triggers)


Uses separate join table with ancestor, descendant, depth (optional)
Cheap ancestry and descendants
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Normalized encoding: good for RDBMS statistics &amp; query planner in joins
Requires multiple rows per node


Lineage Column (a.k.a. Materialized Path, Path Enumeration)


Column: lineage (e.g. /parent/child/grandchild/etc...)
Cheap descendants via prefix query (e.g. LEFT(lineage, #) = '/enumerated/path')
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Non-relational: relies on Array datatype or serialized string format


Nested Intervals


Like nested set, but with real/float/decimal so that the encoding isn't volatile (inexpensive move/insert/delete)
Has real/float/decimal representation/precision issues
Matrix encoding variant adds ancestor encoding (materialized path) for &quot;free&quot;, but with the added trickiness of linear algebra.


Flat Table


A modified Adjacency List that adds a Level and Rank (e.g. ordering) column to each record.
Cheap to iterate/paginate over
Expensive move and delete
Good Use: threaded discussion - forums / blog comments


Multiple lineage columns


Columns: one for each lineage level, refers to all the parents up to the root, levels down from the item's level are set to NULL
Cheap ancestors, descendants, level
Cheap insert, delete, move of the leaves
Expensive insert, delete, move of the internal nodes
Hard limit to how deep the hierarchy can be

Database Specific Notes
MySQL

Use session variables for Adjacency List

Oracle

Use CONNECT BY to traverse Adjacency Lists

PostgreSQL

ltree datatype for Materialized Path

SQL Server

General summary
2008 offers HierarchyId data type that appears to help with the Lineage Column approach and expand the depth that can be represented.

All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.

Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this so that I can CONSISTENTLY fix this problem?

public static void main(String... args) {

   // The comment below is not a typo.

The reason for this is that the Java compiler parses the Unicode character \u000d as a new line and gets transformed into:

public static void main(String... args) {

   // The comment below is not a typo.
   //
   System.out.println(""Hello World!"");
}


Thus resulting into a comment being ""executed"".

342,java,"What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.

I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.

I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);


returns:

0.91239


which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -&gt; 0.91239
0.912300 -&gt; 0.9123

348,android,"I'm working on implementing a widget transparency option for my app widget although I'm having some trouble getting the hex color values right. Being completely new to hex color transparency I searched around a bit although I couldn't find a specific answer to my question. 

I want to set transparency by hex color so let's say my hex color id ""#33b5e5"" and I want it to be 50% transparent. Then I'll use ""#8033b5e5"" because 80 is 50%. 

I found a useful chart here: http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm . With this data I managed to come up with this:

0% = #00
10% = #16
20% = #32
30% = #48
40% = #64
50% = #80
60% = #96
70% = #112
80% = #128
90% = #144

If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?

This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

374,git,"I have a directory structure like this:

.git/
.gitignore
main/
  ...
tools/

Inside main and tools, and any other directory, at any level, there can be a 'bin' directory, which I want to ignore (and I want to ignore everything under it too). I've tried each of these patterns in .gitignore but none of them work:

/**/bin/**/*
/./**/bin/**/*
./**/bin/**/*
**/bin/**/*
*/bin/**/*
bin/**/*
/**/bin/* #and the others with just * at the end too


Can anyone help me out? The first pattern (the one I think should be working) works just fine if I do this:

/main/**/bin/**/*


But I don't want to have an entry for every top-level directory and I don't want to have to modify .gitignore every time I add a new one.

This is on Windows using the latest msysgit.

EDIT: one more thing, there are files and directories that have the substring 'bin' in their names, I don't want those to be ignored :)

"
383,design-patterns,"A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do


Further articles/books on this topic:


What names do you find yourself prepending/appending to classes regularly? 
What’s the best approach to naming classes?
Book: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Hardcover)
Book: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Hardcover)
Book: Implementation Patterns (Paperback)


And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:


Coordinator
Builder
Writer
Reader
Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter
Controller
View
Factory
Entity
Bucket


And a good tip for the road:


  Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important   enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.

387,security,"As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

413,python,"This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t &amp;&amp; y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

427,c#,"I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used [0123456789] in a regex rather than [0-9] or \d. I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.
I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the c# regex engine at least) \d appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:
Regex \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regex [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regex [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first

It's a surprise to me for two reasons, that I would be interested if anyone can shed some light on:

I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.
I can't understand why \d is worse than [0-9]. Is there more to \d than simply shorthand for [0-9]?

None of the above seems optimal. I tend to prefer the tinyint 0/1 variant, since automatic type conversion in PHP gives me boolean values rather simply.

437,git,"Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:


A created repository:

mkdir GitTest2
cd GitTest2
git init

Some modifications in the master take place and get committed:

echo ""On Master"" &gt; file
git commit -a -m ""Initial commit""

Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
echo ""Feature1"" &gt; featureFile
git commit -a -m ""Commit for feature1""

Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:

git checkout master
git branch hotfix1
git checkout hotfix1

The bug is fixed in the hotfix branch and merged back into the master (perhaps after a pull request/code review):

echo ""Bugfix"" &gt; bugfixFile
git commit -a -m ""Bugfix Commit""
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix1

git checkout feature1

456,java,"Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), almost all of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:


  The method must override a superclass method


It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

});


will be initially populated like this:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,
                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }

});


The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.

This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.

Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?

74,git,"I'm using Git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:

master: import of existing codebase plus a few modifications that I'm generally sure of
exp1: experimental branch #1
exp2: experimental branch #2

exp1 and exp2 represent two very different architectural approaches. Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work. As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those.
What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

    long start = 0, stop = 0, elapsed = 0;

    }

    Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: "" + avg);

}

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
    {
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = fibo;
        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }

    return fibo;
}


On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try
    {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
        {
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = fibo;
            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.

"
98,c#,"When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:


  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:

var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();

  
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.


But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..

So then I think:


  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;, so I will inherit from it:

class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}



But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List&lt;T&gt;. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List&lt;T&gt; always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List&lt;T&gt; or not?

113,java,"I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer): 


I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt()
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.
Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
231.5 integers whose square is less than 263).


Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:

public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}


Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.



I've tried the different solutions to the problem:


After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.
The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.
Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.
A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().
Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.
According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.
I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being x megabytes where x is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.

The (absolutely crazy) results

I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):

g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test


Here are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running test 1 (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):


unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003&nbsp;GB/s


As you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):

clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test


Result: test 1


unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB/s


So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:

uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;


to

uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;


Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139&nbsp;GB/s


Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:


unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906&nbsp;GB/s


Wait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!

I asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.

More madness, please!

Take the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:

static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;


Here are my results in g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB/s


Yay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.

My question

Can you explain these results? Especially:


How can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?
How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?
How can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!


I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?

Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?

Lessons learned

No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.

The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.

I don't want to go into the discussion about the smartness of throwing an exception or crashing an entire web application because somebody entered a character in a text box, but I am looking for an elegant way to handle this.

Trapping the exception and showing

doesn't seem professional enough to me.

Disabling post validation (validateRequest=""false"") will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks.

Ideally: When a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded.

126,python,"What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.

By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.

I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyError(""foo"")

It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.

I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.

Update: two answers have suggested overriding __init__, and __str__/__unicode__/__repr__. That seems like a lot of typing, is it necessary?

157,oop,"I have had recently two telephone interviews where I've been asked about the differences between an Interface and an Abstract class. I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.

From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.

Interface:

Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.

Abstract Class:

Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.


After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?
An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.


  Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions.

186,sql,"Good Overviews
Generally speaking, you're making a decision between fast read times (for example, nested set) or fast write times (adjacency list). Usually, you end up with a combination of the options below that best fit your needs. The following provides some in-depth reading:

One more Nested Intervals vs. Adjacency List comparison: the best comparison of Adjacency List, Materialized Path, Nested Set, and Nested Interval I've found.
Models for hierarchical data: slides with good explanations of tradeoffs and example usage
Representing hierarchies in MySQL: very good overview of Nested Set in particular
Hierarchical data in RDBMSs: a most comprehensive and well-organized set of links I've seen, but not much in the way of explanation

Options
Ones I am aware of and general features:

Adjacency List:


Columns: ID, ParentID
Easy to implement.
Cheap node moves, inserts, and deletes.
Expensive to find the level, ancestry &amp; descendants, path
Avoid N+1 via Common Table Expressions in databases that support them


Nested Set (a.k.a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal)


Columns: Left, Right
Cheap ancestry, descendants
Very expensive O(n/2) moves, inserts, deletes due to volatile encoding


Bridge Table (a.k.a. Closure Table /w triggers)


Uses separate join table with ancestor, descendant, depth (optional)
Cheap ancestry and descendants
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Normalized encoding: good for RDBMS statistics &amp; query planner in joins
Requires multiple rows per node


Lineage Column (a.k.a. Materialized Path, Path Enumeration)


Column: lineage (e.g. /parent/child/grandchild/etc...)
Cheap descendants via prefix query (e.g. LEFT(lineage, #) = '/enumerated/path')
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Non-relational: relies on Array datatype or serialized string format


Nested Intervals


Like nested set, but with real/float/decimal so that the encoding isn't volatile (inexpensive move/insert/delete)
Has real/float/decimal representation/precision issues
Matrix encoding variant adds ancestor encoding (materialized path) for &quot;free&quot;, but with the added trickiness of linear algebra.


Flat Table


A modified Adjacency List that adds a Level and Rank (e.g. ordering) column to each record.
Cheap to iterate/paginate over
Expensive move and delete
Good Use: threaded discussion - forums / blog comments


Multiple lineage columns


Columns: one for each lineage level, refers to all the parents up to the root, levels down from the item's level are set to NULL
Cheap ancestors, descendants, level
Cheap insert, delete, move of the leaves
Expensive insert, delete, move of the internal nodes
Hard limit to how deep the hierarchy can be

Database Specific Notes
MySQL

Use session variables for Adjacency List

Oracle

Use CONNECT BY to traverse Adjacency Lists

PostgreSQL

ltree datatype for Materialized Path

SQL Server

General summary
2008 offers HierarchyId data type that appears to help with the Lineage Column approach and expand the depth that can be represented.

228,python,"I'm having problems dealing with unicode characters from text fetched from different web pages (on different sites). I am using BeautifulSoup. 

The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a UnicodeEncodeError. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.

One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:

agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()


Here is a stack trace produced on SOME strings when the snippet above is run:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""foobar.py"", line 792, in &lt;module&gt;
    p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)


I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.

I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.

I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);


returns:

0.91239


which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -&gt; 0.91239
0.912300 -&gt; 0.9123

source bin/activate
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt -f file:///path/to/archive/

I got some output that seems to indicate that the installation is fine:
Downloading/unpacking Fabric==1.2.0 (from -r ../testing/requirements.txt (line 3))
  Running setup.py egg_info for package Fabric
    warning: no previously-included files matching '*' found under directory 'docs/_build'
    warning: no files found matching 'fabfile.py'
Downloading/unpacking South==0.7.3 (from -r ../testing/requirements.txt (line 8))
  Running setup.py egg_info for package South
....

But a later check revealed that none of the packages are installed properly. I cannot import the packages, and none are found in the site-packages directory of my virtualenv. So what went wrong?

260,ios,"I would like to check to see if I have an Internet connection on iOS using the Cocoa Touch libraries or on macOS using the Cocoa libraries.
I came up with a way to do this using an NSURL. The way I did it seems a bit unreliable (because even Google could one day be down and relying on a third party seems bad), and while I could check to see for a response from some other websites if Google didn't respond, it does seem wasteful and an unnecessary overhead on my application.

262,javascript,"Apparently, I have completely misunderstood its semantics. I thought of something like this:


A client downloads javascript code MyCode.js from http://siteA - the origin.
The response header of MyCode.js contains Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteB, which I thought meant that MyCode.js was allowed to make cross-origin references to the site B.
The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to http://siteB, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests.


Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read Cross-origin resource sharing and attempted to read Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in w3c recommendation

One thing is sure - I still do not understand how am I supposed to use this header. 

I have full control of both site A and site B. How do I enable the javascript code downloaded from the site A to access resources on the site B using this header?

273,android,"I have a ListView with a couple of image buttons on each row. When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?

This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.

As soon as I disabled the image on the ListView it worked fine again.

283,design-patterns,"A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do

And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:

Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter

Factory

And a good tip for the road:


  Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important   enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.

287,security,"As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

304,c#,"I'm building a function to extend the Enum.Parse concept that

So I wrote the following:

{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value)) return defaultValue;

Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code.
EDIT All suggestions below have been greatly appreciated, thanks.
Have settled on (I've left the loop to maintain case insensitivity - I am using this when parsing XML)

313,python,"This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t &amp;&amp; y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

327,c#,"I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used [0123456789] in a regex rather than [0-9] or \d. I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.
I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the c# regex engine at least) \d appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:
Regex \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regex [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regex [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first

It's a surprise to me for two reasons, that I would be interested if anyone can shed some light on:

I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.
I can't understand why \d is worse than [0-9]. Is there more to \d than simply shorthand for [0-9]?

tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,

None of the above seems optimal. I tend to prefer the tinyint 0/1 variant, since automatic type conversion in PHP gives me boolean values rather simply.

But SOAP is more standardized (E.g.: security).

337,git,"Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:


A created repository:

mkdir GitTest2
cd GitTest2
git init

Some modifications in the master take place and get committed:

echo ""On Master"" &gt; file
git commit -a -m ""Initial commit""

Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
echo ""Feature1"" &gt; featureFile
git commit -a -m ""Commit for feature1""

Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:

git checkout master
git branch hotfix1
git checkout hotfix1

The bug is fixed in the hotfix branch and merged back into the master (perhaps after a pull request/code review):

echo ""Bugfix"" &gt; bugfixFile
git commit -a -m ""Bugfix Commit""
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix1

Development on feature1 continues:

git checkout feature1



Say I need the hotfix in my feature branch, maybe because the bug also occurs there. How can I achieve this without duplicating the commits into my feature branch?

I want to prevent to get two new commits on my feature branch which have no relation to the feature implementation. This especially seems important for me if I use pull requests: All these commits will also be included in the pull request and have to be reviewed although this has already been done (as the hotfix is already in the master).

I can not do a git merge master --ff-only: ""fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting."", but I am not sure if this helped me.

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.

This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.

Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?

How would I access its members? (myArray[0][1] or myArray[0,1]?)

"
383,javascript,"In PHP, you can do...

range(1, 3); // Array(1, 2, 3)
range(""A"", ""C""); // Array(""A"", ""B"", ""C"")


That is, there is a function that lets you get a range of numbers or characters by passing the upper and lower bounds.

Is there anything built-in to JavaScript natively for this? If not, how would I implement it?

385,javascript,"I'd like to compare two arrays... ideally, efficiently. Nothing fancy, just true if they are identical, and false if not. Not surprisingly, the comparison operator doesn't seem to work.

console.log(a1==a2);    // Returns false

for (Object i : l) {

But this apparently works sometimes, but not always. Here's some specific code:

public static void main(String[] args) {

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {

This, of course, results in:

Even though multiple threads aren't doing it. Anyway.

I'm also using an arbitrary Collection here, not necessarily an ArrayList, so you can't rely on get.

Arrays don't have the namespace problem, but they're too vague, they can be overwritten at runtime and IDEs rarely know how to autofill their keys without additional static analysis annotations or attributes.

I also know that I should be able to add template somewhere to tell the compiler that inUnion is a template-id. But where exactly? And should it then assume that inUnion is a class template, i.e. inUnion&lt;U&gt; names a type and not a function?

If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.

I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.

What are some best practices for naming git branches?

Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.

438,android,"Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:


  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 


Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.

The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.

I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(

Is there a way for me to really quit the application?
"
439,arrays,"I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

442,php,"What is this?
This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.
Why is this?
Questions like &quot;Headers already sent&quot; or &quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot; pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.
What should I do here?
If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.
If you want to contribute, please add your &quot;favorite&quot; error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&amp;A that are of value.

13,java,"I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer): 


I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt()
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.
Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
231.5 integers whose square is less than 263).


Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:

public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}


Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.



I've tried the different solutions to the problem:


After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.
The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.
Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.
A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().
Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.
According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.
I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being x megabytes where x is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.

The (absolutely crazy) results

I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):

g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test


Here are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running test 1 (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):


unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003&nbsp;GB/s


As you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):

clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test


Result: test 1


unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB/s


So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:

uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;


to

uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;


Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139&nbsp;GB/s


Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:


unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884&nbsp;GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906&nbsp;GB/s


Wait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!

I asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.

More madness, please!

Take the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:

static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;


Here are my results in g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB/s


Yay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.

My question

Can you explain these results? Especially:


How can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?
How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?
How can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!


I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?

The Disassembly

Here is the disassembly for the various results:

26&nbsp;GB/s version from g++ / u32 / non-const bufsize:

0x400af8:
lea 0x1(%rdx),%eax
popcnt (%rbx,%rax,8),%r9
lea 0x2(%rdx),%edi
popcnt (%rbx,%rcx,8),%rax

popcnt (%rbx,%rsi,8),%rcx
add %rcx,%rax
mov %edx,%ecx
add %rax,%r14
cmp %rbp,%rcx
jb 0x400af8


13&nbsp;GB/s version from g++ / u64 / non-const bufsize:

0x400c00:
popcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx
popcnt (%rbx,%rdx,8),%rax
add %rcx,%rax
popcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx
add %rcx,%rax
popcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx
add $0x4,%rdx
add %rcx,%rax
add %rax,%r12
cmp %rbp,%rdx
jb 0x400c00


15&nbsp;GB/s version from clang++ / u64 / non-const bufsize:

0x400e50:
popcnt (%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx
add %rbx,%rdx
popcnt 0x8(%r15,%rcx,8),%rsi
add %rdx,%rsi

popcnt 0x18(%r15,%rcx,8),%rbx
add %rdx,%rbx
add $0x4,%rcx
cmp %rbp,%rcx
jb 0x400e50


20&nbsp;GB/s version from g++ / u32&amp;u64 / const bufsize:

0x400a68:
popcnt (%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax
popcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rcx
add %rax,%rcx
popcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax

popcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rsi
add $0x20,%rdx
add %rsi,%rcx
add %rcx,%rbp

jne 0x400a68


15&nbsp;GB/s version from clang++ / u32&amp;u64 / const bufsize:

0x400dd0:
popcnt (%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx
add %rbx,%rdx
popcnt 0x8(%r14,%rcx,8),%rsi
add %rdx,%rsi
popcnt 0x10(%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx
add %rsi,%rdx
popcnt 0x18(%r14,%rcx,8),%rbx
add %rdx,%rbx
add $0x4,%rcx
cmp $0x20000,%rcx
jb 0x400dd0


Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?

Lessons learned

No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.

The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.

25,asp.net,"Every time a user posts something containing &lt; or &gt; in a page in my web application, I get this exception thrown.

I don't want to go into the discussion about the smartness of throwing an exception or crashing an entire web application because somebody entered a character in a text box, but I am looking for an elegant way to handle this.

Trapping the exception and showing


  An error has occurred please go back and re-type your entire form again, but this time please do not use &lt;


doesn't seem professional enough to me.

Disabling post validation (validateRequest=""false"") will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks.

Ideally: When a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded.
So the .Text property of my text-box will be something &amp; lt; html &amp; gt;

26,python,"What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.

By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.

I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyError(""foo"")
_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6


It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.

I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.

Update: two answers have suggested overriding __init__, and __str__/__unicode__/__repr__. That seems like a lot of typing, is it necessary?

My version of node is always v0.6.1-pre even after I install brew node and NVM install v0.6.19.

From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.

Interface:

Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.

Abstract Class:

Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.


After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?
An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

72,javascript,"I need to get execution time in milliseconds.

I currently have a website with a body font-size of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16 pixels.

I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16 pixels whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full-blown widescreen desktop.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as well as having extra breakpoints, otherwise, I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100pixels decrease in width to control the text.

85,javascript,"I noticed that JavaScript's new Date() function is very smart in accepting dates in several formats.

Xmas95 = new Date(""20 09 2006,12:52:39"")


I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling new Date() function.

This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.


  Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions.


Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.

var d1 = new Date();
d1.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');       //Returns ""2009-06-29"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
d1.toString('dddd, MMMM ,yyyy')  //Returns ""Monday, June 29,2009"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome


Also here I couldn't find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string.

Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?

86,sql,"Good Overviews
Generally speaking, you're making a decision between fast read times (for example, nested set) or fast write times (adjacency list). Usually, you end up with a combination of the options below that best fit your needs. The following provides some in-depth reading:

One more Nested Intervals vs. Adjacency List comparison: the best comparison of Adjacency List, Materialized Path, Nested Set, and Nested Interval I've found.
Models for hierarchical data: slides with good explanations of tradeoffs and example usage
Representing hierarchies in MySQL: very good overview of Nested Set in particular
Hierarchical data in RDBMSs: a most comprehensive and well-organized set of links I've seen, but not much in the way of explanation

Options
Ones I am aware of and general features:

Adjacency List:


Columns: ID, ParentID
Easy to implement.
Cheap node moves, inserts, and deletes.
Expensive to find the level, ancestry &amp; descendants, path
Avoid N+1 via Common Table Expressions in databases that support them


Nested Set (a.k.a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal)


Columns: Left, Right
Cheap ancestry, descendants
Very expensive O(n/2) moves, inserts, deletes due to volatile encoding


Bridge Table (a.k.a. Closure Table /w triggers)


Uses separate join table with ancestor, descendant, depth (optional)
Cheap ancestry and descendants
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Normalized encoding: good for RDBMS statistics &amp; query planner in joins
Requires multiple rows per node


Lineage Column (a.k.a. Materialized Path, Path Enumeration)


Column: lineage (e.g. /parent/child/grandchild/etc...)
Cheap descendants via prefix query (e.g. LEFT(lineage, #) = '/enumerated/path')
Writes costs O(log n) (size of the subtree) for insert, updates, deletes
Non-relational: relies on Array datatype or serialized string format


Nested Intervals


Like nested set, but with real/float/decimal so that the encoding isn't volatile (inexpensive move/insert/delete)
Has real/float/decimal representation/precision issues
Matrix encoding variant adds ancestor encoding (materialized path) for &quot;free&quot;, but with the added trickiness of linear algebra.


Flat Table


A modified Adjacency List that adds a Level and Rank (e.g. ordering) column to each record.
Cheap to iterate/paginate over
Expensive move and delete
Good Use: threaded discussion - forums / blog comments


Multiple lineage columns


Columns: one for each lineage level, refers to all the parents up to the root, levels down from the item's level are set to NULL
Cheap ancestors, descendants, level
Cheap insert, delete, move of the leaves
Expensive insert, delete, move of the internal nodes
Hard limit to how deep the hierarchy can be

Database Specific Notes
MySQL

Use session variables for Adjacency List

Oracle

Use CONNECT BY to traverse Adjacency Lists

PostgreSQL

ltree datatype for Materialized Path

SQL Server

General summary
2008 offers HierarchyId data type that appears to help with the Lineage Column approach and expand the depth that can be represented.

Python 3.6 has now introduced another string formatting format of string literals (aka &quot;f&quot; strings) via the syntax f&quot;my string&quot;. Is this formatting option better than the others?

The following uses each method and has the same outcome, so what is the difference?
 #!/usr/bin/python
 sub1 = &quot;python string!&quot;
 sub2 = &quot;an arg&quot;

 sub_a = &quot;i am a %s&quot; % sub1

128,python,"I'm having problems dealing with unicode characters from text fetched from different web pages (on different sites). I am using BeautifulSoup. 

The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a UnicodeEncodeError. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.

One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:

agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()


Here is a stack trace produced on SOME strings when the snippet above is run:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""foobar.py"", line 792, in &lt;module&gt;
    p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)


I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.

Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this so that I can CONSISTENTLY fix this problem?

public static void main(String... args) {

The reason for this is that the Java compiler parses the Unicode character \u000d as a new line and gets transformed into:

public static void main(String... args) {

   // The comment below is not a typo.
   //
   System.out.println(""Hello World!"");

142,java,"What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.

I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.

I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);


returns:

0.91239


which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -&gt; 0.91239
0.912300 -&gt; 0.9123

Inside main and tools, and any other directory, at any level, there can be a 'bin' directory, which I want to ignore (and I want to ignore everything under it too). I've tried each of these patterns in .gitignore but none of them work:

/**/bin/**/*
/./**/bin/**/*
./**/bin/**/*
**/bin/**/*

/**/bin/* #and the others with just * at the end too


Can anyone help me out? The first pattern (the one I think should be working) works just fine if I do this:

/main/**/bin/**/*


But I don't want to have an entry for every top-level directory and I don't want to have to modify .gitignore every time I add a new one.

EDIT: one more thing, there are files and directories that have the substring 'bin' in their names, I don't want those to be ignored :)

"
183,design-patterns,"A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do


Further articles/books on this topic:


What names do you find yourself prepending/appending to classes regularly? 
What’s the best approach to naming classes?
Book: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Hardcover)
Book: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Hardcover)
Book: Implementation Patterns (Paperback)


And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:


Coordinator
Builder
Writer
Reader
Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter
Controller
View
Factory
Entity
Bucket


And a good tip for the road:


  Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important   enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.

184,git,"I currently have three modified files in my working directory. However I want one of them to be reset to the HEAD status.

187,security,"As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

How does it affect us if we keep the unused modules?

204,c#,"I'm building a function to extend the Enum.Parse concept that

Allows a default value to be parsed in case that an Enum value is not found
Is case insensitive

So I wrote the following:
public static T GetEnumFromString&lt;T&gt;(string value, T defaultValue) where T : Enum
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value)) return defaultValue;
    foreach (T item in Enum.GetValues(typeof(T)))

Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code.
EDIT All suggestions below have been greatly appreciated, thanks.
Have settled on (I've left the loop to maintain case insensitivity - I am using this when parsing XML)

213,python,"This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t &amp;&amp; y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

227,c#,"I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used [0123456789] in a regex rather than [0-9] or \d. I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.
I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the c# regex engine at least) \d appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:
Regex \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regex [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regex [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first

It's a surprise to me for two reasons, that I would be interested if anyone can shed some light on:

I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.
I can't understand why \d is worse than [0-9]. Is there more to \d than simply shorthand for [0-9]?

237,git,"Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:


A created repository:

mkdir GitTest2
cd GitTest2

Some modifications in the master take place and get committed:

echo ""On Master"" &gt; file
git commit -a -m ""Initial commit""

Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
echo ""Feature1"" &gt; featureFile
git commit -a -m ""Commit for feature1""

Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:

git checkout master
git branch hotfix1

git checkout feature1

250,sql-server,"I would like this to be the ultimate discussion on how to check if a table exists in SQL Server 2000/2005 using SQL Statements.

When you Google for the answer, you get so many different answers. Is there an official/backward and forward compatible way of doing it?

Here are two possible ways of doing it. Which one among the two is the standard/best way of doing it?

First way:

IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
           WHERE TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE' 
           AND TABLE_NAME='mytablename') 
   SELECT 1 AS res ELSE SELECT 0 AS res;


Second way:

IF OBJECT_ID (N'mytablename', N'U') IS NOT NULL 
   SELECT 1 AS res ELSE SELECT 0 AS res;


MySQL provides the simple 

SHOW TABLES LIKE '%tablename%'; 


statement. I am looking for something similar.

256,java,"Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), almost all of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:


  The method must override a superclass method


It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

});


will be initially populated like this:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,
                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }

});


The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.

This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.

Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?

If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.

I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.

Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.

I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a constant number of characters.


The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP
It must be safe
It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?)


Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer?

In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password protection mechanism.

338,android,"Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:


  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 


Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.

The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.

I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(

Is there a way for me to really quit the application?
"
339,arrays,"I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

342,php,"What is this?
This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.
Why is this?
Questions like &quot;Headers already sent&quot; or &quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot; pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.
What should I do here?
If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.

"
408,python,"The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often tupling.
Option: Using a tuple
Consider this trivial example:
def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)

However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.
Option: Using a dictionary
The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict.
Consider the following:
def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}

(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)
Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,
result['y0']

Option: Using a class
However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:
class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all { y0, y1, y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue.
There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

From the Python Reference Manual:

The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.

Option: Using a dataclass (Python 3.7+)
Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:
@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

Option: Using a list
Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:
def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result

This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.
A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, whereas tuples are not.
I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.

Relative imports in python 2.5
Relative imports in Python
Python: Disabling relative import

and plenty of URLs that I did not copy, some on SO, some on other sites, back when I thought I'd have the solution quickly.
The forever-recurring question is this: how do I solve this &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot; message?
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package

I built an exact replica of the package on pep-0328:
package/
    __init__.py

        __init__.py
        moduleX.py
        moduleY.py
    subpackage2/
        __init__.py
        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py

The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot;? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by &quot;non-package&quot;, why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.

417,string,"I feel a bit thick at this point. I've spent days trying to fully wrap my head around suffix tree construction, but because I don't have a mathematical background, many of the explanations elude me as they start to make excessive use of mathematical symbology. The closest to a good explanation that I've found is Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees, but he glosses over various points and some aspects of the algorithm remain unclear.

A step-by-step explanation of this algorithm here on Stack&nbsp;Overflow would be invaluable for many others besides me, I'm sure.

For reference, here's Ukkonen's paper on the algorithm: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf

My basic understanding, so far:


I need to iterate through each prefix P of a given string T
I need to iterate through each suffix S in prefix P and add that to tree
To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.


The basic algorithm appears to be O(n2), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think that is what I'm having trouble understanding.

I'm also having trouble understanding:


exactly when and how the ""active point"" is assigned, used and changed
what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm
Why the implementations I've seen need to ""fix"" bounding variables that they are using




Here is the completed C# source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:


  https://gist.github.com/2373868




Update 2017-11-04

After many years I've found a new use for suffix trees, and have implemented the algorithm in JavaScript. Gist is below. It should be bug-free. Dump it into a js file, npm install chalk from the same location, and then run with node.js to see some colourful output. There's a stripped down version in the same Gist, without any of the debugging code.

class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    @property
    def x(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;I'm the 'x' property.&quot;&quot;&quot;

454,android,"I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application.

What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout.

That file I take is from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted.

For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views?


If my activity implements
OnGestureListener I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the Grid or the Image views that I
add.

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...

If my activity implements
OnTouchListener then I have no
onFling method to override (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...

If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.


I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.

// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});


Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?

If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create?

This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream).

471,python,"I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.

One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.

My first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:

What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:


Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure
Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure
Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas


Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".

Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:


Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.
In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.
I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.
I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.


I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.

Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:


I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.
Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.
Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.
A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.
It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.
The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.


It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).

476,git,"OK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
       \    
        D--E  (feature)


I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

But now I want to rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
                 \
                  D'--E'  (feature)


Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the force push, I'm not going to lose any data, the question is more conceptual.

491,vim,"I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.

The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:


Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)


Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.

Copy/Cut &amp; paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.

With Vim it's horrible:


yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!


Another example? Search &amp; replace.


In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.


And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)

My question is:

What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)

28,python,"I'm having problems dealing with unicode characters from text fetched from different web pages (on different sites). I am using BeautifulSoup. 

The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a UnicodeEncodeError. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.

One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:

agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()


Here is a stack trace produced on SOME strings when the snippet above is run:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""foobar.py"", line 792, in &lt;module&gt;
    p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)


I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.

Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this so that I can CONSISTENTLY fix this problem?

42,java,"What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.

I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.

I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);


returns:

0.91239


which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -&gt; 0.91239
0.912300 -&gt; 0.9123

60,ios,"I would like to check to see if I have an Internet connection on iOS using the Cocoa Touch libraries or on macOS using the Cocoa libraries.
I came up with a way to do this using an NSURL. The way I did it seems a bit unreliable (because even Google could one day be down and relying on a third party seems bad), and while I could check to see for a response from some other websites if Google didn't respond, it does seem wasteful and an unnecessary overhead on my application.

62,javascript,"Apparently, I have completely misunderstood its semantics. I thought of something like this:


A client downloads javascript code MyCode.js from http://siteA - the origin.
The response header of MyCode.js contains Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteB, which I thought meant that MyCode.js was allowed to make cross-origin references to the site B.
The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to http://siteB, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests.


Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read Cross-origin resource sharing and attempted to read Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in w3c recommendation

One thing is sure - I still do not understand how am I supposed to use this header. 

I have full control of both site A and site B. How do I enable the javascript code downloaded from the site A to access resources on the site B using this header?

73,android,"I have a ListView with a couple of image buttons on each row. When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?

This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.

83,design-patterns,"A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do

And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:

Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter

Factory

And a good tip for the road:


  Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important   enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.

87,security,"As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

104,c#,"I'm building a function to extend the Enum.Parse concept that

Allows a default value to be parsed in case that an Enum value is not found

So I wrote the following:

{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value)) return defaultValue;
    foreach (T item in Enum.GetValues(typeof(T)))

Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code.
EDIT All suggestions below have been greatly appreciated, thanks.
Have settled on (I've left the loop to maintain case insensitivity - I am using this when parsing XML)

    public static T ParseEnum&lt;T&gt;(string value, T defaultValue) where T : struct, IConvertible

113,python,"This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t &amp;&amp; y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

127,c#,"I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used [0123456789] in a regex rather than [0-9] or \d. I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.
I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the c# regex engine at least) \d appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:
Regex \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regex [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regex [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first

It's a surprise to me for two reasons, that I would be interested if anyone can shed some light on:

I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.
I can't understand why \d is worse than [0-9]. Is there more to \d than simply shorthand for [0-9]?

tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,

None of the above seems optimal. I tend to prefer the tinyint 0/1 variant, since automatic type conversion in PHP gives me boolean values rather simply.

But SOAP is more standardized (E.g.: security).

137,git,"Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:


A created repository:

mkdir GitTest2
cd GitTest2
git init

Some modifications in the master take place and get committed:

echo ""On Master"" &gt; file
git commit -a -m ""Initial commit""

Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
echo ""Feature1"" &gt; featureFile
git commit -a -m ""Commit for feature1""

Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:

git checkout master
git branch hotfix1
git checkout hotfix1

The bug is fixed in the hotfix branch and merged back into the master (perhaps after a pull request/code review):

echo ""Bugfix"" &gt; bugfixFile
git commit -a -m ""Bugfix Commit""
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix1

Development on feature1 continues:

git checkout feature1



Say I need the hotfix in my feature branch, maybe because the bug also occurs there. How can I achieve this without duplicating the commits into my feature branch?

I want to prevent to get two new commits on my feature branch which have no relation to the feature implementation. This especially seems important for me if I use pull requests: All these commits will also be included in the pull request and have to be reviewed although this has already been done (as the hotfix is already in the master).

I can not do a git merge master --ff-only: ""fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting."", but I am not sure if this helped me.

The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.

This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.

Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?

How would I access its members? (myArray[0][1] or myArray[0,1]?)

"
183,javascript,"In PHP, you can do...

range(1, 3); // Array(1, 2, 3)
range(""A"", ""C""); // Array(""A"", ""B"", ""C"")


That is, there is a function that lets you get a range of numbers or characters by passing the upper and lower bounds.

Is there anything built-in to JavaScript natively for this? If not, how would I implement it?

185,javascript,"I'd like to compare two arrays... ideally, efficiently. Nothing fancy, just true if they are identical, and false if not. Not surprisingly, the comparison operator doesn't seem to work.

console.log(a1==a2);    // Returns false

for (Object i : l) {
    if (condition(i)) {

But this apparently works sometimes, but not always. Here's some specific code:

public static void main(String[] args) {

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {

This, of course, results in:

Exception in thread ""main"" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException


Even though multiple threads aren't doing it. Anyway.

What's the best solution to this problem? How can I remove an item from the collection in a loop without throwing this exception?

I'm also using an arbitrary Collection here, not necessarily an ArrayList, so you can't rely on get.

Arrays don't have the namespace problem, but they're too vague, they can be overwritten at runtime and IDEs rarely know how to autofill their keys without additional static analysis annotations or attributes.

I also know that I should be able to add template somewhere to tell the compiler that inUnion is a template-id. But where exactly? And should it then assume that inUnion is a class template, i.e. inUnion&lt;U&gt; names a type and not a function?

If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.

I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.

What are some best practices for naming git branches?

Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.

238,android,"Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:


  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 


Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.

The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.

I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(

Is there a way for me to really quit the application?
"
239,arrays,"I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

242,php,"What is this?
This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.
Why is this?
Questions like &quot;Headers already sent&quot; or &quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot; pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.
What should I do here?
If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.
If you want to contribute, please add your &quot;favorite&quot; error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&amp;A that are of value.

"
308,python,"The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often tupling.
Option: Using a tuple
Consider this trivial example:
def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)

However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.
Option: Using a dictionary
The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict.
Consider the following:
def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}

(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)
Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,
result['y0']

Option: Using a class
However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:
class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all { y0, y1, y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue.
There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

From the Python Reference Manual:

The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.

Option: Using a dataclass (Python 3.7+)
Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:
@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

Option: Using a list
Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:
def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result

This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.
A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, whereas tuples are not.
I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.
Question
After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?

        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py

The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot;? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by &quot;non-package&quot;, why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.

317,string,"I feel a bit thick at this point. I've spent days trying to fully wrap my head around suffix tree construction, but because I don't have a mathematical background, many of the explanations elude me as they start to make excessive use of mathematical symbology. The closest to a good explanation that I've found is Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees, but he glosses over various points and some aspects of the algorithm remain unclear.

A step-by-step explanation of this algorithm here on Stack&nbsp;Overflow would be invaluable for many others besides me, I'm sure.

For reference, here's Ukkonen's paper on the algorithm: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf

My basic understanding, so far:


I need to iterate through each prefix P of a given string T
I need to iterate through each suffix S in prefix P and add that to tree
To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.


The basic algorithm appears to be O(n2), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think that is what I'm having trouble understanding.

I'm also having trouble understanding:


exactly when and how the ""active point"" is assigned, used and changed
what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm
Why the implementations I've seen need to ""fix"" bounding variables that they are using




Here is the completed C# source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:

324,vim,"I've started using Vim to develop Perl scripts and am starting to find it very powerful. 

One thing I like is to be able to open multiple files at once with:

vi main.pl maintenance.pl

:n

and see which file are open with:

:args


And to add a file, I can say:

325,javascript,"Using core jQuery, how do you remove all the options of a select box, then add one option and select it?

My select box is the following.

&lt;Select id=""mySelect"" size=""9""&gt; &lt;/Select&gt;


EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) .val('whatever') did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both .append and .val.)

$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()
.append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');


EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. .focus() was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with .selected= ""true"". Nothing is wrong with my existing code - I am just trying to learn jQuery.

var mySelect = document.getElementById('mySelect');
mySelect.options.length = 0;
mySelect.options[0] = new Option (""Foo (only choice)"", ""Foo"");
mySelect.options[0].selected=""true"";


EDIT: selected answer was close to what I needed. This worked for me:

$('#mySelect').children().remove().end()
.append('&lt;option selected value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;') ;

354,android,"I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application.

What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout.

That file I take is from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted.

For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views?


If my activity implements
OnGestureListener I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the Grid or the Image views that I
add.

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...

If my activity implements
OnTouchListener then I have no
onFling method to override (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...

If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.


I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.

// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});


Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?

If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create?

This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream).

371,python,"I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.

One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.

My first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:

What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:


Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure
Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure
Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas


Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".

Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:


Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.
In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.
I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.
I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.


I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.

Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:


I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.
Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.
Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.
A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.
It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.
The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.


It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).

I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

Android documentation for creating custom dialog boxes: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html

If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs. Simply create an activity and set its theme to Theme.Holo.Dialog in 
the &lt;activity&gt; manifest element:

&lt;activity android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog"" &gt;


However, when I tried this I get the following exception:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity


I am supporting the following, and I can't using something greater than 10 for the min:

minSdkVersion 10
targetSdkVersion 19


In my styles I have the following:

&lt;!-- Base application theme. --&gt;
    &lt;style name=""AppTheme"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar""&gt;


And in my manifest I have this for the activity:

 &lt;application
        android:allowBackup=""true""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""@string/app_name""

391,vim,"I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.

The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:


Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)


Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.

Copy/Cut &amp; paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.

With Vim it's horrible:


yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!


Another example? Search &amp; replace.


In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.


And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)

My question is:

What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

I'd expect this to show 99, 104, 140000. Instead it shows 104, 140000, 99. So it seems the sort is handling the values as strings.

Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:


Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)
Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)

Can someone explain how to use which one when?

My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...


sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.

This would allow me to link from one .md to another within the same branch and not have to worry about which branch I'm in (avoid having to do an absolute URL that includes the github.com branch name).

Here is a working example of what I mean:


GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel, link does not work.
GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel/blob/master/README.md, link works.


This is expected because at this point the starting URL is in the branch. Now how do I get it to pick up the current branch in the README.md at the root of the repository?

Update: I opened an issue against GitHub for this feature request.

439,oop,"Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?

448,android,"I've built a simple music player in Android. The view for each song contains a SeekBar, implemented like this:

This works fine. Now I want a timer counting the seconds/minutes of the progress of the song. So I put a TextView in the layout, get it with findViewById() in onCreate(), and put this in run() after progress.setProgress(pos):

currentTime.setText(time);  // currentTime = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.current_time);


But that last line gives me the exception:

Yet I'm doing basically the same thing here as I'm doing with the SeekBar - creating the view in onCreate, then touching it in run() - and it doesn't give me this complaint.

451,javascript,"Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching $.ajax calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our $.ajax calls are POST methods and we have cache set to false {cache:false}, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a TimeStamp to the headers but it did not help.
We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType)

This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.
Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?

The workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)

and then always pass in a TimeStamp parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.

477,java,"How to mock methods with void return type? 

I implemented an observer pattern but I can't mock it with Mockito because I don't know how.

    void addListener(Listener item) {
        listeners.add(item);

In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t &amp;&amp; y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

But what is bcrypt? PHP doesn't offer any such functions, Wikipedia babbles about a file-encryption utility and Web searches just reveal a few implementations of Blowfish in different languages. Now Blowfish is also available in PHP via mcrypt, but how does that help with storing passwords? Blowfish is a general purpose cipher, it works two ways. If it could be encrypted, it can be decrypted. Passwords need a one-way hashing function.

What is the explanation?

26,c#,"I am playing with LINQ to learn about it, but I can't figure out how to use Distinct when I do not have a simple list (a simple list of integers is pretty easy to do, this is not the question). What I if want to use Distinct on a list of an Object on one or more properties of the object?

Example: If an object is Person, with Property Id. How can I get all Person and use Distinct on them with the property Id of the object?

Person1: Id=1, Name=""Test1""
Person2: Id=1, Name=""Test1""
Person3: Id=2, Name=""Test2""

27,c#,"I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used [0123456789] in a regex rather than [0-9] or \d. I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.
I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the c# regex engine at least) \d appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:
Regex \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regex [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regex [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first

It's a surprise to me for two reasons, that I would be interested if anyone can shed some light on:

I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.
I can't understand why \d is worse than [0-9]. Is there more to \d than simply shorthand for [0-9]?

None of the above seems optimal. I tend to prefer the tinyint 0/1 variant, since automatic type conversion in PHP gives me boolean values rather simply.

37,git,"Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:


A created repository:

mkdir GitTest2
cd GitTest2
git init

Some modifications in the master take place and get committed:

echo ""On Master"" &gt; file
git commit -a -m ""Initial commit""

Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
echo ""Feature1"" &gt; featureFile
git commit -a -m ""Commit for feature1""

Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:

git checkout master
git branch hotfix1
git checkout hotfix1

The bug is fixed in the hotfix branch and merged back into the master (perhaps after a pull request/code review):

echo ""Bugfix"" &gt; bugfixFile
git commit -a -m ""Bugfix Commit""
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix1

Development on feature1 continues:

git checkout feature1



Say I need the hotfix in my feature branch, maybe because the bug also occurs there. How can I achieve this without duplicating the commits into my feature branch?

I want to prevent to get two new commits on my feature branch which have no relation to the feature implementation. This especially seems important for me if I use pull requests: All these commits will also be included in the pull request and have to be reviewed although this has already been done (as the hotfix is already in the master).

If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.

I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.

What are some best practices for naming git branches?

Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.

132,php,"It is currently said that MD5 is partially unsafe. Taking this into consideration, I'd like to know which mechanism to use for password protection.

This question, Is “double hashing” a password less secure than just hashing it once? 
suggests that hashing multiple times may be a good idea, whereas How to implement password protection for individual files? suggests using salt.

I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a constant number of characters.


The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP
It must be safe
It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?)


Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer?

In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password protection mechanism.

138,android,"Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:


  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 


Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.

The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.

I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(

Is there a way for me to really quit the application?
"
139,arrays,"I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.
Why is this?
Questions like &quot;Headers already sent&quot; or &quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot; pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.
What should I do here?
If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.

I want to do some programming with the latest JavaFX, which requires Java 8. I'm using IntelliJ 13 CE and Mac OS X 9 Mavericks. I ran Oracle's Java 8 installer, and the files look like they ended up at
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_05.jdk

but previous versions are at
/System/Library/Java/JavaFrameworks/jdk1.6....

Not sure why the latest installer puts this in /Library instead of /System/Library (nor what the difference is). But /usr/libexec/java_home doesn't find 1.8, so all the posts I've found on how to set your current java version don't work. I've tried adding a symbolic link to make it look like 1.8 is in the /System/Library... path, but it doesn't help. /usr/libexec/java_home -V still only lists the old Java 1.6.
Ironically, the &quot;Java&quot; control panel under System Preferences shows only Java 1.8!
Why doesn't Oracle's installer put it where it really goes? And how can I work around this problem?

179,python,"I'm building a web application with Django. The reasons I chose Django were:


I wanted to work with free/open-source tools.
I like Python and feel it's a long-term language, whereas regarding Ruby I wasn't sure, and PHP seemed like a huge hassle to learn.
I'm building a prototype for an idea and wasn't thinking too much about the future. Development speed was the main factor, and I already knew Python.
I knew the migration to Google App Engine would be easier should I choose to do so in the future.
I heard Django was ""nice"".


Now that I'm getting closer to thinking about publishing my work, I start being concerned about scale. The only information I found about the scaling capabilities of Django is provided by the Django team (I'm not saying anything to disregard them, but this is clearly not objective information...).

My questions:


What's the ""largest"" site that's built on Django today? (I measure size mostly by user traffic)
Can Django deal with 100,000 users daily, each visiting the site for a couple of hours?
Could a site like Stack Overflow run on Django?

"
208,python,"The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often tupling.
Option: Using a tuple
Consider this trivial example:
def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)

However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.
Option: Using a dictionary
The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict.
Consider the following:
def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}

(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)
Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,
result['y0']

Option: Using a class
However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:
class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all { y0, y1, y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue.
There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

From the Python Reference Manual:

The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.

Option: Using a dataclass (Python 3.7+)
Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:
@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

Option: Using a list
Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:
def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result

This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.
A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, whereas tuples are not.
I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.

After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?

The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot;? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by &quot;non-package&quot;, why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.

217,string,"I feel a bit thick at this point. I've spent days trying to fully wrap my head around suffix tree construction, but because I don't have a mathematical background, many of the explanations elude me as they start to make excessive use of mathematical symbology. The closest to a good explanation that I've found is Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees, but he glosses over various points and some aspects of the algorithm remain unclear.

A step-by-step explanation of this algorithm here on Stack&nbsp;Overflow would be invaluable for many others besides me, I'm sure.

For reference, here's Ukkonen's paper on the algorithm: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf

My basic understanding, so far:


I need to iterate through each prefix P of a given string T
I need to iterate through each suffix S in prefix P and add that to tree
To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.


The basic algorithm appears to be O(n2), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think that is what I'm having trouble understanding.

I'm also having trouble understanding:


exactly when and how the ""active point"" is assigned, used and changed
what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm
Why the implementations I've seen need to ""fix"" bounding variables that they are using




Here is the completed C# source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:


  https://gist.github.com/2373868




Update 2017-11-04

After many years I've found a new use for suffix trees, and have implemented the algorithm in JavaScript. Gist is below. It should be bug-free. Dump it into a js file, npm install chalk from the same location, and then run with node.js to see some colourful output. There's a stripped down version in the same Gist, without any of the debugging code.

219,python,"I would like to understand how the built-in function property works. What confuses me is that property can also be used as a decorator, but it only takes arguments when used as a built-in function and not when used as a decorator.
This example is from the documentation:
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    def getx(self):
        return self._x
    def setx(self, value):
        self._x = value
    def delx(self):
        del self._x
    x = property(getx, setx, delx, &quot;I'm the 'x' property.&quot;)

property's arguments are getx, setx, delx and a doc string.
In the code below property is used as a decorator. The object of it is the x function, but in the code above there is no place for an object function in the arguments.
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    @property
    def x(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;I'm the 'x' property.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return self._x

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        self._x = value

    @x.deleter
    def x(self):
        del self._x

How are the x.setter and x.deleter decorators created in this case?

225,javascript,"Using core jQuery, how do you remove all the options of a select box, then add one option and select it?

My select box is the following.

EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) .val('whatever') did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both .append and .val.)

$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()
.append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');


EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. .focus() was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with .selected= ""true"". Nothing is wrong with my existing code - I am just trying to learn jQuery.

mySelect.options.length = 0;
mySelect.options[0] = new Option (""Foo (only choice)"", ""Foo"");

254,android,"I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application.

What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout.

That file I take is from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted.

For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views?


If my activity implements
OnGestureListener I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the Grid or the Image views that I
add.

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...

If my activity implements
OnTouchListener then I have no
onFling method to override (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...

If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.


I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.

// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();

One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.

My first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:

What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:


Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure
Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure
Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas


Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".

Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:


Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.
In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.
I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.
I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.


I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.

The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.
Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.
Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.
A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.
It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.
The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.


It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).

276,git,"OK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?

I have a master branch and a feature branch. I do some work on master, some on feature, and then some more on master. I end up with something like this (lexicographic order implies the order of commits):

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
       \    
        D--E  (feature)


I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

But now I want to rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
                 \
                  D'--E'  (feature)


Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the force push, I'm not going to lose any data, the question is more conceptual.

Android documentation for creating custom dialog boxes: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html

If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs. Simply create an activity and set its theme to Theme.Holo.Dialog in 
the &lt;activity&gt; manifest element:

&lt;activity android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog"" &gt;


However, when I tried this I get the following exception:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity


I am supporting the following, and I can't using something greater than 10 for the min:

minSdkVersion 10
targetSdkVersion 19


In my styles I have the following:

&lt;!-- Base application theme. --&gt;
    &lt;style name=""AppTheme"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar""&gt;


And in my manifest I have this for the activity:

 &lt;application
        android:allowBackup=""true""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""@string/app_name""

291,vim,"I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.

The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:


Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)


Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.

Copy/Cut &amp; paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.

With Vim it's horrible:


yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!


Another example? Search &amp; replace.


In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.


And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)

My question is:

What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

I'd expect this to show 99, 104, 140000. Instead it shows 104, 140000, 99. So it seems the sort is handling the values as strings.

Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?

Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who come from functional languages? 

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:


Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)
Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)

My problem is that when a user enters a zero into the text box, I need to disable the input-image's event handler. I have tried the following, but to no avail.

$('#myimage').click(function { return false; });

332,r,"Whenever I want to do something ""map""py in R, I usually try to use a function in the apply family.

Can someone explain how to use which one when?

My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...


sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.

339,oop,"Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?

351,javascript,"Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching $.ajax calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our $.ajax calls are POST methods and we have cache set to false {cache:false}, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a TimeStamp to the headers but it did not help.
We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType)

This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.
Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?

The workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)

and then always pass in a TimeStamp parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.

#listen_addresses = 'localhost'        # what IP address(es) to listen on;
#port = 5432                # (change requires restart)

a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.

b. Create one single Node.js server which handles all Node.js requests. This reads the requested files and evals their contents. So the files are interpreted on each request, but the server logic is much simpler.

And that new syntax emerged from the effort to have a way to express &quot;template typedef&quot;:
template&lt; class T &gt; using MyType = AnotherType&lt; T, MyAllocatorType &gt;;

But, with the first two non-template examples, are there any other subtle differences in the standard? For example, typedefs do aliasing in a &quot;weak&quot; way. That is it does not create a new type but only a new name (conversions are implicit between those names).
Is it the same with using or does it generate a new type? Are there any differences?

412,android,"I'm trying to use the new Android Studio but I can't seem to get it working correctly.

I'm using the Gson library to serialize/deserialize JSON-objects. But the library somehow isn't included in the build.

I had created a new project with just a MainActivity.
Copied gson-2.2.3.jar in the /libs folder and added it as a library dependancy(right click->Add as library). This includes the jar in android studio so it can be referenced from the source files.

When I try to run the project it cannot compile so I added:

compile files('libs/gson-2.2.3.jar')


to the dependencies in de .gradle file. After that it compiles correctly but when running the application I get a ClassDefNotFoundException.

"
428,html,"Although elements like &lt;div&gt;s normally grow to fit their contents, using the float property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.
For example:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height: 0.
How do you solve this problem?
I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.
Solution 1
Float the parent.


&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?
Solution 2
Give the parent an explicit height.


&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.
Solution 3
Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Straightforward to code.
Cons: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.
Solution 4
Set parent to overflow: auto.


&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Doesn't require extra div.
Cons: Seems like a hack - that's not the overflow property's stated purpose.

Notice how the select method is added to $scope, but the addPane method is added to this. If I change it to $scope.addPane, the code breaks.

docker run --volumes-from c0dbc34fd631 -d app_name/postgres


IMHO, that has the drawback, that I must not ever (by accident) delete container ""c0dbc34fd631"".

Another idea would be to mount host volumes ""-v"" into the container, however, the userid within the container does not necessarily match the userid from the host, and then permissions might be messed up.

Note: Instead of --volumes-from 'cryptic_id' you can also use --volumes-from my-data-container where my-data-container is a name you assigned to a data-only container, e.g. docker run --name my-data-container ... (see the accepted answer)

If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.

Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)

37,sql-server,"I have a limited exposure to DB and have only used DB as an application programmer. I want to know about Clustered and Non clustered indexes.
I googled and what I found was :


  A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders  the way
  records in the table are physically
  stored.  Therefore table can have only
  one clustered index. The leaf  nodes
  of a clustered index contain the data
  pages. A nonclustered index is a
  special type of index in which  the
  logical order of the index does not
  match the physical  stored order of
  the rows on disk. The leaf node of a 
  nonclustered index does not consist of
  the data pages.  Instead, the leaf
  nodes contain index rows.


What I found in SO was What are the differences between a clustered and a non-clustered index?.

Can someone explain this in plain English?

38,android,"Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:


  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 


Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.

The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.

I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(

Is there a way for me to really quit the application?
"
39,arrays,"I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

42,php,"What is this?
This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.
Why is this?
Questions like &quot;Headers already sent&quot; or &quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot; pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.
What should I do here?
If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone.
If you want to contribute, please add your &quot;favorite&quot; error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&amp;A that are of value.

"
108,python,"The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often tupling.
Option: Using a tuple
Consider this trivial example:
def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)

However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.
Option: Using a dictionary
The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict.
Consider the following:
def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}

(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)
Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,
result['y0']

Option: Using a class
However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:
class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all { y0, y1, y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue.
There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

From the Python Reference Manual:

The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.

Option: Using a dataclass (Python 3.7+)
Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:
@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

Option: Using a list
Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:
def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result

This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.
A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, whereas tuples are not.
I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.

I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot;? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.

117,string,"I feel a bit thick at this point. I've spent days trying to fully wrap my head around suffix tree construction, but because I don't have a mathematical background, many of the explanations elude me as they start to make excessive use of mathematical symbology. The closest to a good explanation that I've found is Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees, but he glosses over various points and some aspects of the algorithm remain unclear.

A step-by-step explanation of this algorithm here on Stack&nbsp;Overflow would be invaluable for many others besides me, I'm sure.

For reference, here's Ukkonen's paper on the algorithm: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf

My basic understanding, so far:


I need to iterate through each prefix P of a given string T
I need to iterate through each suffix S in prefix P and add that to tree
To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.


The basic algorithm appears to be O(n2), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think that is what I'm having trouble understanding.

I'm also having trouble understanding:


exactly when and how the ""active point"" is assigned, used and changed
what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm
Why the implementations I've seen need to ""fix"" bounding variables that they are using




Here is the completed C# source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:


  https://gist.github.com/2373868

property's arguments are getx, setx, delx and a doc string.

My select box is the following.

&lt;Select id=""mySelect"" size=""9""&gt; &lt;/Select&gt;


EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) .val('whatever') did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both .append and .val.)

$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()
.append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');


EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset.

154,android,"I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application.

What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout.

That file I take is from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted.

For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views?


If my activity implements
OnGestureListener I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the Grid or the Image views that I
add.

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...

If my activity implements
OnTouchListener then I have no
onFling method to override (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...

If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.


I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.

// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});


Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?

If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create?

This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream).

171,python,"I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.

One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.

My first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:

What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:


Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure
Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure
Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas


Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".

Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:


Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.
In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.
I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.
I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.


I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.

Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:


I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.
Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.
Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.
A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.
It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.
The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.


It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).

176,git,"OK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?

I have a master branch and a feature branch. I do some work on master, some on feature, and then some more on master. I end up with something like this (lexicographic order implies the order of commits):

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
       \    
        D--E  (feature)


I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

But now I want to rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
                 \
                  D'--E'  (feature)


Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the force push, I'm not going to lose any data, the question is more conceptual.

If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs. Simply create an activity and set its theme to Theme.Holo.Dialog in 
the &lt;activity&gt; manifest element:

&lt;activity android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog"" &gt;


However, when I tried this I get the following exception:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity


I am supporting the following, and I can't using something greater than 10 for the min:

minSdkVersion 10
targetSdkVersion 19


In my styles I have the following:

&lt;!-- Base application theme. --&gt;
    &lt;style name=""AppTheme"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar""&gt;


And in my manifest I have this for the activity:

 &lt;application

        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""@string/app_name""

191,vim,"I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.

The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:


Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)


Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.

Copy/Cut &amp; paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.

With Vim it's horrible:


yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!


Another example? Search &amp; replace.


In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.


And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)

My question is:

What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

I'd expect this to show 99, 104, 140000. Instead it shows 104, 140000, 99. So it seems the sort is handling the values as strings.

Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?

Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who come from functional languages? 

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:


Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)
Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)

sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.


Side question: I still haven't learned plyr or reshape -- would plyr or reshape replace all of these entirely?

233,javascript,"How would I go about removing all of the child elements of a DOM node in JavaScript?

Say I have the following (ugly) HTML:

&lt;p id=""foo""&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;world&lt;/div&gt;

How could I remove the children of foo so that just &lt;p id=""foo""&gt;&lt;/p&gt; is left?

Could I just do:

myNode.childNodes = new Array();


or should I be using some combination of removeElement?

I'd like the answer to be straight up DOM; though extra points if you also provide an answer in jQuery along with the DOM-only answer.

234,github,"Is there a way to create a URL anchor, &lt;a&gt;, link from within a Markdown file, to another file within the same repository and branch (aka a link relative to the current branch)?

# My Project
is really really cool. My Project has a subdir named myLib, see below.

## myLib documentation
see documentation [here](myLib/README.md)


This would allow me to link from one .md to another within the same branch and not have to worry about which branch I'm in (avoid having to do an absolute URL that includes the github.com branch name).

Here is a working example of what I mean:


GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel, link does not work.
GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel/blob/master/README.md, link works.


This is expected because at this point the starting URL is in the branch. Now how do I get it to pick up the current branch in the README.md at the root of the repository?

239,oop,"Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?

But that last line gives me the exception:

Yet I'm doing basically the same thing here as I'm doing with the SeekBar - creating the view in onCreate, then touching it in run() - and it doesn't give me this complaint.

251,javascript,"Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching $.ajax calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our $.ajax calls are POST methods and we have cache set to false {cache:false}, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a TimeStamp to the headers but it did not help.
We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType)

This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.
Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?

The workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)

and then always pass in a TimeStamp parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.

How should they work together? How should I handle the requests?
There are 2 concepts for a Node.js server, which one is better:   

a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.

b. Create one single Node.js server which handles all Node.js requests. This reads the requested files and evals their contents. So the files are interpreted on each request, but the server logic is much simpler.


It's not clear for me how to use Node.js correctly.

328,html,"Although elements like &lt;div&gt;s normally grow to fit their contents, using the float property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.
For example:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height: 0.
How do you solve this problem?
I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.
Solution 1
Float the parent.


&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?
Solution 2
Give the parent an explicit height.


&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.
Solution 3
Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Straightforward to code.
Cons: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.
Solution 4
Set parent to overflow: auto.


&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Doesn't require extra div.
Cons: Seems like a hack - that's not the overflow property's stated purpose.

I have read (vaguely, through posts on the Internet) that cross apply can be more efficient when selecting over large data sets if you are partitioning. (Paging comes to mind)

I also know that CROSS APPLY doesn't require a UDF as the right-table.

In most INNER JOIN queries (one-to-many relationships), I could rewrite them to use CROSS APPLY, but they always give me equivalent execution plans. 

Can anyone give me a good example of when CROSS APPLY makes a difference in those cases where INNER JOIN will work as well?

"
416,git,"I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

And the banner moves, exactly as expected, but no animation.

UPDATE: I re-watched WWDC 12 talk Best Practices for Mastering Auto Layout which covers animation. It discusses how to update constraints using CoreAnimation:


I've tried with the following code, but get the exact same results:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

On a side note, I have checked numerous times and this is being executed on the main thread.

How to find time complexity of an algorithm?

What have I done before posting a question on SO ?

I have gone through this, this and many other links

But no where I was able to find a clear and straight forward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.

What do I know ?

Say for a code as simple as the one below:

char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time


Say for a loop like the one below: 

for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {        
    Console.Write('Hello World !');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.
The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i &lt; N;  This will be executed N+1 times

i++ ;   This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are

{1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2

Note: This still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding on calculating time complexity

What I want to know ?

Ok, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as 

O(N), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!).... and many other, 

Can anyone help me understand how does one calculate time complexity of an algorithm? I am sure there are plenty of newbies like me wanting to know this.

485,javascript,"I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a &lt;select&gt; dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded &lt;select&gt; had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected &lt;option&gt;, because sometimes the &lt;select&gt;'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected &lt;option&gt;'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;

I've got a solution for my problem, but I'm uneasy that I don't know exactly why this fixes my problem.  Does anyone have an official explanation?  What browser issue am I avoiding by calling my function ""later"" using setTimeout()?

"
8,python,"The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often tupling.
Option: Using a tuple
Consider this trivial example:
def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)

However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.
Option: Using a dictionary
The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict.
Consider the following:
def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}

(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)
Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,
result['y0']

Option: Using a class
However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:
class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all { y0, y1, y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue.
There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as:
class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

From the Python Reference Manual:

The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.

Option: Using a dataclass (Python 3.7+)
Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:
@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)

Option: Using a list
Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:
def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result

This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.
A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, whereas tuples are not.
I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.
Question
After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?

The forever-recurring question is this: how do I solve this &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot; message?

        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py

The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot;? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by &quot;non-package&quot;, why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.

17,string,"I feel a bit thick at this point. I've spent days trying to fully wrap my head around suffix tree construction, but because I don't have a mathematical background, many of the explanations elude me as they start to make excessive use of mathematical symbology. The closest to a good explanation that I've found is Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees, but he glosses over various points and some aspects of the algorithm remain unclear.

A step-by-step explanation of this algorithm here on Stack&nbsp;Overflow would be invaluable for many others besides me, I'm sure.

For reference, here's Ukkonen's paper on the algorithm: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf

My basic understanding, so far:


I need to iterate through each prefix P of a given string T
I need to iterate through each suffix S in prefix P and add that to tree
To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.


The basic algorithm appears to be O(n2), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think that is what I'm having trouble understanding.

I'm also having trouble understanding:


exactly when and how the ""active point"" is assigned, used and changed
what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm
Why the implementations I've seen need to ""fix"" bounding variables that they are using




Here is the completed C# source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:


  https://gist.github.com/2373868




Update 2017-11-04

After many years I've found a new use for suffix trees, and have implemented the algorithm in JavaScript. Gist is below. It should be bug-free. Dump it into a js file, npm install chalk from the same location, and then run with node.js to see some colourful output. There's a stripped down version in the same Gist, without any of the debugging code.

19,python,"I would like to understand how the built-in function property works. What confuses me is that property can also be used as a decorator, but it only takes arguments when used as a built-in function and not when used as a decorator.

    def __init__(self):

25,javascript,"Using core jQuery, how do you remove all the options of a select box, then add one option and select it?

My select box is the following.

&lt;Select id=""mySelect"" size=""9""&gt; &lt;/Select&gt;


EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) .val('whatever') did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both .append and .val.)

$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()
.append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');


EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset.

54,android,"I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application.

What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout.

That file I take is from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted.

For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views?


If my activity implements
OnGestureListener I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the Grid or the Image views that I
add.

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...

If my activity implements
OnTouchListener then I have no
onFling method to override (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).

public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...

If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.


I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.

// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});


Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?

If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create?

This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream).

71,python,"I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.

One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.

My first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:

What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:


Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure
Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure
Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas


Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".

Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:


Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.
In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.
I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.
I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.


I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.

Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:


I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.
Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.
Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.
A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.
It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.
The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.


It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).

       \    
        D--E  (feature)


I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

But now I want to rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
                 \
                  D'--E'  (feature)


Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the force push, I'm not going to lose any data, the question is more conceptual.

Android documentation for creating custom dialog boxes: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html

If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs. Simply create an activity and set its theme to Theme.Holo.Dialog in 
the &lt;activity&gt; manifest element:

&lt;activity android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog"" &gt;


However, when I tried this I get the following exception:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity


I am supporting the following, and I can't using something greater than 10 for the min:

minSdkVersion 10
targetSdkVersion 19


In my styles I have the following:

&lt;!-- Base application theme. --&gt;
    &lt;style name=""AppTheme"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar""&gt;


And in my manifest I have this for the activity:

 &lt;application
        android:allowBackup=""true""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""@string/app_name""

91,vim,"I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.

The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:


Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)


Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.

Copy/Cut &amp; paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.

With Vim it's horrible:


yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!


Another example? Search &amp; replace.


In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.


And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)

My question is:

What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

I'd expect this to show 99, 104, 140000. Instead it shows 104, 140000, 99. So it seems the sort is handling the values as strings.

Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?

Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who come from functional languages? 

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:


Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)
Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)
Undo/Redo functionality

apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.

134,github,"Is there a way to create a URL anchor, &lt;a&gt;, link from within a Markdown file, to another file within the same repository and branch (aka a link relative to the current branch)?

This would allow me to link from one .md to another within the same branch and not have to worry about which branch I'm in (avoid having to do an absolute URL that includes the github.com branch name).

139,oop,"Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?

But that last line gives me the exception:

151,javascript,"Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching $.ajax calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our $.ajax calls are POST methods and we have cache set to false {cache:false}, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a TimeStamp to the headers but it did not help.
We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType)

This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.
Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?

The workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)

and then always pass in a TimeStamp parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.

How should they work together? How should I handle the requests?
There are 2 concepts for a Node.js server, which one is better:   

a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.

b. Create one single Node.js server which handles all Node.js requests. This reads the requested files and evals their contents. So the files are interpreted on each request, but the server logic is much simpler.


It's not clear for me how to use Node.js correctly.

"
228,html,"Although elements like &lt;div&gt;s normally grow to fit their contents, using the float property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.
For example:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height: 0.
How do you solve this problem?
I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.
Solution 1
Float the parent.


&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?
Solution 2
Give the parent an explicit height.


&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.
Solution 3
Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Straightforward to code.
Cons: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.
Solution 4
Set parent to overflow: auto.


&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Doesn't require extra div.
Cons: Seems like a hack - that's not the overflow property's stated purpose.

I have read (vaguely, through posts on the Internet) that cross apply can be more efficient when selecting over large data sets if you are partitioning. (Paging comes to mind)

I also know that CROSS APPLY doesn't require a UDF as the right-table.

In most INNER JOIN queries (one-to-many relationships), I could rewrite them to use CROSS APPLY, but they always give me equivalent execution plans. 

Can anyone give me a good example of when CROSS APPLY makes a difference in those cases where INNER JOIN will work as well?

Here's a trivial example, where the execution plans are exactly the same.  (Show me one where they differ and where cross apply is faster/more efficient)

316,git,"I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

And the banner moves, exactly as expected, but no animation.

UPDATE: I re-watched WWDC 12 talk Best Practices for Mastering Auto Layout which covers animation. It discusses how to update constraints using CoreAnimation:


I've tried with the following code, but get the exact same results:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

On a side note, I have checked numerous times and this is being executed on the main thread.

How to find time complexity of an algorithm?

What have I done before posting a question on SO ?

I have gone through this, this and many other links

But no where I was able to find a clear and straight forward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.

What do I know ?

Say for a code as simple as the one below:

char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time


Say for a loop like the one below: 

for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {        
    Console.Write('Hello World !');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.
The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i &lt; N;  This will be executed N+1 times

i++ ;   This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are

{1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2

Note: This still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding on calculating time complexity

What I want to know ?

Ok, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as 

O(N), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!).... and many other, 

Can anyone help me understand how does one calculate time complexity of an algorithm? I am sure there are plenty of newbies like me wanting to know this.

385,javascript,"I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a &lt;select&gt; dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded &lt;select&gt; had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected &lt;option&gt;, because sometimes the &lt;select&gt;'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected &lt;option&gt;'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;
    }
})();
setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);


And this worked!

I've got a solution for my problem, but I'm uneasy that I don't know exactly why this fixes my problem.  Does anyone have an official explanation?  What browser issue am I avoiding by calling my function ""later"" using setTimeout()?

Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.
The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

442,swift,"I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    for j in 0..&lt;n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

443,python,"I'm trying to figure out Python lambdas.  Is lambda one of those ""interesting"" language items that in real life should be forgotten? 

I'm sure there are some edge cases where it might be needed, but given the obscurity of it, the potential of it being redefined in future releases (my assumption based on the various definitions of it) and the reduced coding clarity - should it be avoided?  

This reminds me of overflowing (buffer overflow) of C types - pointing to the top variable and overloading to set the other field values.  It feels like sort of a techie showmanship but maintenance coder nightmare.

I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

480,linux,"Is there a simple shell command/script that supports excluding certain files/folders from being archived?

I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.

Not quite solutions:

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

"
491,javascript,"In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:

When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS
to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the
style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript
includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before
continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering
thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the
styles it needs.

My actual testing reveals something quite different:
My test harness
I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:
require 'rubygems'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'evma_httpserver'
require 'date'

class Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection
  include EventMachine::HttpServer

  def process_http_request
    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )

    return unless @http_query_string

    path = @http_path_info
    array = @http_query_string.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;).map{|s| s.split(&quot;=&quot;)}.flatten
    parsed = Hash[*array]

    delay = parsed[&quot;delay&quot;].to_i / 1000.0
    jsdelay = parsed[&quot;jsdelay&quot;].to_i

    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)
    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)

    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0) 
    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)

    # Block which fulfills the request
    operation = proc do
      sleep delay 

      if path.match(/.js$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/javascript&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;(function(){
            var start = new Date();
            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}
          })();&quot;
      end
      if path.match(/.css$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/css&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;body {font-size: 50px;}&quot;
      end
    end

    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled
    callback = proc do |res|
        resp.send_response
    end

    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request
    EM.defer(operation, callback)
  end
end

EventMachine::run {
  EventMachine::start_server(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 8081, Handler)
  puts &quot;Listening...&quot;
}

The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.
I use the following page to test.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
          var startTime = new Date();
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elapsed time is: 
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
        document.write(new Date() - startTime);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:

When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:

I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.
What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.
Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?
It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:

public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}


Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:

string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);


Okay now all of these work like a charm but I find it a whole lot of work. I was wondering if there is a better solution for this.

I also tried something with a dictionary and static properties but that wasn't better either.

Can someone explain how to use which one when?

My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...


sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.

39,oop,"Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?

51,javascript,"Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching $.ajax calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our $.ajax calls are POST methods and we have cache set to false {cache:false}, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a TimeStamp to the headers but it did not help.
We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType)

This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.
Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?

The workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:
getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)

and then always pass in a TimeStamp parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.

52,angularjs,"I've read the AngularJS documentation on the topic carefully, and then fiddled around with a directive. Here's the fiddle.

From the pane directive:

scope: { biTitle: '=', title: '@', bar: '=' },



There are several things I don't get:


Why do I have to use ""{{title}}"" with '@' and ""title"" with '='?
Can I also access the parent scope directly, without decorating my element with an attribute?
The documentation says ""Often it's desirable to pass data from the isolated scope via expression and to the parent scope"", but that seems to work fine with bidirectional binding too. Why would the expression route be better?


I found another fiddle that shows the expression solution too: http://jsfiddle.net/maxisam/QrCXh/

I found a related question right here on SO, but that question is about PHP though, and it states the b is used to indicate the string is binary, as opposed to Unicode, which was needed for code to be compatible from version of PHP &lt; 6, when migrating to PHP 6. I don't think this applies to Python.

I did find this documentation on the Python site about using a u character in the same syntax to specify a string as Unicode. Unfortunately, it doesn't mention the b character anywhere in that document.

Ideally, the solution would not force the browser to reload the file on every visit to the page.

I have found John Millikin's and da5id's suggestion to be useful. It turns out there is a term for this: auto-versioning.
I have posted a new answer below which is a combination of my original solution and John's suggestion.
Another idea that was suggested by SCdF would be to append a bogus query string to the file. (Some Python code, to automatically use the timestamp as a bogus query string, was submitted by pi..)
However, there is some discussion as to whether or not the browser would cache a file with a query string. (Remember, we want the browser to cache the file and use it on future visits. We only want it to fetch the file again when it has changed.)

This raises the question:
How do I start the PostgreSQL server?
Update:
&gt; pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
server starting
sh: /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log: No such file or directory

Update 2:
The touch was not successful, so I did this instead:
&gt; mkdir /usr/local/var/postgres
&gt; vi /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log
&gt; ls /usr/local/var/postgres/
server.log

But when I try to start the Ruby on Rails server, I still see this:

Is the server running on host &quot;localhost&quot; and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432?

Update 3:
&gt; pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres status
pg_ctl: no server running

Update 4:
I found that there wasn't any pg_hba.conf file (only file pg_hba.conf.sample), so I modified the sample and renamed it (to remover the .sample). Here are the contents:
 # IPv4 local connections:
 host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32           trust
 # IPv6 local connections:
 host    all             all             ::1/128                trust

But I don't understand this:
&gt; pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
server starting
&gt; pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres status
pg_ctl: no server running

Also:
sudo find / -name postgresql.conf
find: /dev/fd/3: Not a directory
find: /dev/fd/4: Not a directory

Update 5:
sudo pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
Password:
pg_ctl: cannot be run as root
Please log in (using, e.g., &quot;su&quot;) as the (unprivileged) user that will own the server process.

Update 6:
This seems odd:
&gt; egrep 'listen|port' /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf
egrep: /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf: No such file or directory

Though, I did do this:
&gt;sudo find / -name &quot;*postgresql.conf*&quot;
find: /dev/fd/3: Not a directory
find: /dev/fd/4: Not a directory
/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample
/usr/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample

So I did this:
egrep 'listen|port' /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'        # what IP address(es) to listen on;
#port = 5432                # (change requires restart)
                # supported by the operating system:
                #   %r = remote host and port

So I tried this:
&gt; cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf
&gt; cp /usr/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf.sample /usr/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf

a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.

128,html,"Although elements like &lt;div&gt;s normally grow to fit their contents, using the float property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.
For example:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height: 0.
How do you solve this problem?
I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.
Solution 1
Float the parent.


&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?
Solution 2
Give the parent an explicit height.


&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.
Solution 3
Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Straightforward to code.
Cons: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.
Solution 4
Set parent to overflow: auto.


&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Doesn't require extra div.
Cons: Seems like a hack - that's not the overflow property's stated purpose.

This is a WCF server in a Windows service. The method NotifySubscribers() is called by the service whenever there is a data event (at random intervals, but not very often - about 800 times per day).
When a Windows Forms client subscribes, the subscriber ID is added to the subscribers dictionary, and when the client unsubscribes, it is deleted from the dictionary. The error happens when (or after) a client unsubscribes. It appears that the next time the NotifySubscribers() method is called, the foreach() loop fails with the error in the subject line.

Another idea would be to mount host volumes ""-v"" into the container, however, the userid within the container does not necessarily match the userid from the host, and then permissions might be messed up.

Note: Instead of --volumes-from 'cryptic_id' you can also use --volumes-from my-data-container where my-data-container is a name you assigned to a data-only container, e.g. docker run --name my-data-container ... (see the accepted answer)

216,git,"I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Old style, I set the frame in an animation block.

Is there a syntax for more appropriately adding a comment?

How to find time complexity of an algorithm?

What have I done before posting a question on SO ?

I have gone through this, this and many other links

But no where I was able to find a clear and straight forward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.

What do I know ?

Say for a code as simple as the one below:

char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time


Say for a loop like the one below: 

for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {        
    Console.Write('Hello World !');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.
The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i &lt; N;  This will be executed N+1 times

i++ ;   This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are

{1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2

Note: This still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding on calculating time complexity

What I want to know ?

Ok, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as 

O(N), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!).... and many other, 

Can anyone help me understand how does one calculate time complexity of an algorithm? I am sure there are plenty of newbies like me wanting to know this.

285,javascript,"I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a &lt;select&gt; dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded &lt;select&gt; had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected &lt;option&gt;, because sometimes the &lt;select&gt;'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected &lt;option&gt;'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {

I have always used expr in the past, but unless it runs in RPN mode I do not think it is going to cope with this (and even then it would be tricky).

How can I get the summation of integers?

309,python,"I happened to find myself having a basic filtering need: I have a list and I have to filter it by an attribute of the items.

My code looked like this:

my_list = [x for x in my_list if x.attribute == value]


But then I thought, wouldn't it be better to write it like this?

my_list = filter(lambda x: x.attribute == value, my_list)


It's more readable, and if needed for performance the lambda could be taken out to gain something.  

Question is: are there any caveats in using the second way? Any performance difference? Am I missing the Pythonic Way™ entirely and should do it in yet another way (such as using itemgetter instead of the lambda)?

Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.
The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

342,swift,"I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    for j in 0..&lt;n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

357,python,"I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found.

"
391,javascript,"In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:

When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS
to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the
style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript
includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before
continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering
thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the
styles it needs.

My actual testing reveals something quite different:
My test harness
I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:
require 'rubygems'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'evma_httpserver'
require 'date'

class Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection
  include EventMachine::HttpServer

  def process_http_request
    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )

    return unless @http_query_string

    path = @http_path_info
    array = @http_query_string.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;).map{|s| s.split(&quot;=&quot;)}.flatten
    parsed = Hash[*array]

    delay = parsed[&quot;delay&quot;].to_i / 1000.0
    jsdelay = parsed[&quot;jsdelay&quot;].to_i

    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)
    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)

    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0) 
    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)

    # Block which fulfills the request
    operation = proc do
      sleep delay 

      if path.match(/.js$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/javascript&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;(function(){
            var start = new Date();
            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}
          })();&quot;
      end
      if path.match(/.css$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/css&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;body {font-size: 50px;}&quot;
      end
    end

    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled
    callback = proc do |res|
        resp.send_response
    end

    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request
    EM.defer(operation, callback)
  end
end

EventMachine::run {
  EventMachine::start_server(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 8081, Handler)
  puts &quot;Listening...&quot;
}

The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.
I use the following page to test.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
          var startTime = new Date();
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elapsed time is: 
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
        document.write(new Date() - startTime);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:

When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:

I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.
What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.
Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?
It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.

I have found the following solution for this problem (link):

First I need to create a custom attribute called ""StringValue"":

public class StringValue : System.Attribute
{
    private readonly string _value;

    public StringValue(string value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {
        get { return _value; }
    }

}


Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:

public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:

public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}


Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:

string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);


Okay now all of these work like a charm but I find it a whole lot of work. I was wondering if there is a better solution for this.

I also tried something with a dictionary and static properties but that wasn't better either.

"
418,json,"First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.

Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered &quot;a set of changes&quot; and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with &quot;patch document&quot;. In my case it would be the json document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.com'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:

PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?

PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of &quot;patching&quot; or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:

What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?

430,maven,"What is the difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies?
I have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.
It seems that a dependency defined under the dependencyManagement can be used in its child modules without specifying the version. 

For example:

A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the dependencyManagement:

&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;3.8&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
 &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;


Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit:

  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;

However, I wonder if it is necessary to define junit in the parent pom? Why not define it directly in the needed module?

If it has, the script prints the message ""MyApplicationName is just installed"" and ends (return 1 mean that ends with an “error”, doesn’t it?).

28,html,"Although elements like &lt;div&gt;s normally grow to fit their contents, using the float property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.
For example:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height: 0.
How do you solve this problem?
I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.
Solution 1
Float the parent.


&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?
Solution 2
Give the parent an explicit height.


&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Semantic code.
Cons: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.
Solution 3
Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:


&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Straightforward to code.
Cons: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.
Solution 4
Set parent to overflow: auto.


&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



Pros: Doesn't require extra div.
Cons: Seems like a hack - that's not the overflow property's stated purpose.

Below is the code.
This is a WCF server in a Windows service. The method NotifySubscribers() is called by the service whenever there is a data event (at random intervals, but not very often - about 800 times per day).
When a Windows Forms client subscribes, the subscriber ID is added to the subscribers dictionary, and when the client unsubscribes, it is deleted from the dictionary. The error happens when (or after) a client unsubscribes. It appears that the next time the NotifySubscribers() method is called, the foreach() loop fails with the error in the subject line.

Another idea would be to mount host volumes ""-v"" into the container, however, the userid within the container does not necessarily match the userid from the host, and then permissions might be messed up.

Note: Instead of --volumes-from 'cryptic_id' you can also use --volumes-from my-data-container where my-data-container is a name you assigned to a data-only container, e.g. docker run --name my-data-container ... (see the accepted answer)

116,git,"I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Old style, I set the frame in an animation block.

How to find time complexity of an algorithm?

What have I done before posting a question on SO ?

I have gone through this, this and many other links

But no where I was able to find a clear and straight forward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.

What do I know ?

Say for a code as simple as the one below:

char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time


Say for a loop like the one below: 

for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {        
    Console.Write('Hello World !');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.
The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i &lt; N;  This will be executed N+1 times

i++ ;   This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are

{1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2

Note: This still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding on calculating time complexity

What I want to know ?

Ok, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as 

O(N), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!).... and many other, 

Can anyone help me understand how does one calculate time complexity of an algorithm? I am sure there are plenty of newbies like me wanting to know this.

185,javascript,"I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a &lt;select&gt; dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded &lt;select&gt; had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected &lt;option&gt;, because sometimes the &lt;select&gt;'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected &lt;option&gt;'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {

It's more readable, and if needed for performance the lambda could be taken out to gain something.

The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

242,swift,"I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    for j in 0..&lt;n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

257,python,"I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found.

"
291,javascript,"In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:

When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS
to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the
style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript
includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before
continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering
thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the
styles it needs.

My actual testing reveals something quite different:
My test harness
I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:
require 'rubygems'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'evma_httpserver'
require 'date'

class Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection
  include EventMachine::HttpServer

  def process_http_request
    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )

    return unless @http_query_string

    path = @http_path_info
    array = @http_query_string.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;).map{|s| s.split(&quot;=&quot;)}.flatten
    parsed = Hash[*array]

    delay = parsed[&quot;delay&quot;].to_i / 1000.0
    jsdelay = parsed[&quot;jsdelay&quot;].to_i

    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)
    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)

    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0) 
    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)

    # Block which fulfills the request
    operation = proc do
      sleep delay 

      if path.match(/.js$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/javascript&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;(function(){
            var start = new Date();
            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}
          })();&quot;
      end
      if path.match(/.css$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/css&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;body {font-size: 50px;}&quot;
      end
    end

    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled
    callback = proc do |res|
        resp.send_response
    end

    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request
    EM.defer(operation, callback)
  end
end

EventMachine::run {
  EventMachine::start_server(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 8081, Handler)
  puts &quot;Listening...&quot;
}

The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.
I use the following page to test.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
          var startTime = new Date();
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elapsed time is: 
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
        document.write(new Date() - startTime);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:

When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:

I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.
What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.
Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?
It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.

I have found the following solution for this problem (link):

First I need to create a custom attribute called ""StringValue"":

public class StringValue : System.Attribute
{
    private readonly string _value;

    public StringValue(string value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {
        get { return _value; }
    }

}


Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:

public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:

public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}


Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:

string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);


Okay now all of these work like a charm but I find it a whole lot of work. I was wondering if there is a better solution for this.

I also tried something with a dictionary and static properties but that wasn't better either.

318,json,"First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.

Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered &quot;a set of changes&quot; and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with &quot;patch document&quot;. In my case it would be the json document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.com'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:

PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?

PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of &quot;patching&quot; or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:

What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?

330,maven,"What is the difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies?
I have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.
It seems that a dependency defined under the dependencyManagement can be used in its child modules without specifying the version. 

For example:

A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the dependencyManagement:

&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;3.8&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
 &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;


Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit:

  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;

However, I wonder if it is necessary to define junit in the parent pom? Why not define it directly in the needed module?

If it has, the script prints the message ""MyApplicationName is just installed"" and ends (return 1 mean that ends with an “error”, doesn’t it?).

467,reactjs,"I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.

With a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).

Here's a code example:

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  handleButtonClick() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        {Math.random()}
        &lt;button onClick={this.handleButtonClick.bind(this)}&gt;
          Click me
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}


Clicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.

So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?

I know about the compiler optimizations to improve speed and everything, but I don’t see many ways to further optimize my assembly solution (speaking programmatically, not mathematically).
The C++ code uses modulus every term and division every other term, while the assembly code only uses a single division every other term.
But the assembly is taking on average 1 second longer than the C++ solution. Why is this? I am asking mainly out of curiosity.

474,css,"Consider the main axis and cross axis of a flex container:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: W3C

To align flex items along the main axis there is one property:


justify-content


To align flex items along the cross axis there are three properties:


align-content
align-items
align-self


In the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. These are the default directions of a flex container.

However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the flex-direction property.

/* main axis is horizontal, cross axis is vertical */
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;

/* main axis is vertical, cross axis is horizontal */    
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;


(The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.)

My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and flex-direction makes it easy to switch back and forth. 

So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties?

Why are align-content and align-items consolidated into one property for the main axis?

Why does the main axis not get a justify-self property?



Scenarios where these properties would be useful:


placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container
#box3 { align-self: flex-end; justify-self: flex-end; }
making a group of flex items align-right (justify-content: flex-end) but have the first item align left (justify-self: flex-start)

Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With justify-self the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly (""flexes"") to different screen sizes.
in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  (justify-content: center) and align the adjacent items to the container edges (justify-self: flex-start and justify-self: flex-end). 

Note that values space-around and space-between on
justify-content property  will not keep the middle item centered about the container if the adjacent items have different widths.




#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 75px;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
}
.box3 {
  width: 200px;
}
#center {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#center &gt; span {
  background-color: aqua;
  padding: 2px;
}
&lt;div id=""center""&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;TRUE CENTER&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box1""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box2""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box3""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note that the middlebox will only be truly centered if adjacent boxes are equal width&lt;/p&gt;




jsFiddle version



As of this writing, there is no mention of justify-self or justify-items in the flexbox spec.

However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: W3C

You'll notice that justify-self and justify-items are being considered... but not for flexbox.



I'll end by reiterating the main question:


  Why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?

If I replace 2 * (i * i) with 2 * i * i, it takes between 0.60 and 0.65 secs to run. How come?

I ran each version of the program 15 times, alternating between the two. Here are the results:

 2*(i*i)  |  2*i*i
----------+----------
0.5183738 | 0.6246434
0.5298337 | 0.6049722
0.5308647 | 0.6603363

0.5237389 | 0.627815
0.5249942 | 0.6114252

0.5048032 | 0.6511559
0.5232789 | 0.6544526


The fastest run of 2 * i * i took longer than the slowest run of 2 * (i * i). If they had the same efficiency, the probability of this happening would be less than 1/2^15 * 100% = 0.00305%.

I have found three methods to which I'll mention the pros and cons:

Method 1 - Load original record, update each property

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    original.BusinessEntityId = updatedUser.BusinessEntityId;
    original.Email = updatedUser.Email;
    original.EmployeeId = updatedUser.EmployeeId;
    original.Forename = updatedUser.Forename;
    original.Surname = updatedUser.Surname;
    original.Telephone = updatedUser.Telephone;
    original.Title = updatedUser.Title;
    original.Fax = updatedUser.Fax;
    original.ASPNetUserId = updatedUser.ASPNetUserId;
    db.SaveChanges();
}    


Pros


Can specify which properties change
Views don't need to contain every property


Cons


2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 2 - Load original record, set changed values

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    db.Entry(original).CurrentValues.SetValues(updatedUser);
    db.SaveChanges();
}


Pros


Only modified properties are sent to database


Cons


Views need to contain every property
2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 3 - Attach updated record and set state to EntityState.Modified

db.Users.Attach(updatedUser);
db.Entry(updatedUser).State = EntityState.Modified;
db.SaveChanges();


Pros


1 x query on database to update


Cons


Can't specify which properties change
Views must contain every property


Question

My question to you guys; is there a clean way that I can achieve this set of goals?


Can specify which properties change
Views don't need to contain every property (such as password!)
1 x query on database to update

16,git,"I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've also tried git fetch mod, which appears to do a fetch (but can't possibly, because it's not prompting for a password!), but git log and git show deny the existence of new commits. Thus far I've just been rm-ing the module and re-adding it, but this is both wrong in principle and tedious in practice.

27,ios,"I'm updating an old app with an AdBannerView and when there is no ad, it slides off screen. When there is an ad it slides on the screen. Basic stuff.
Old style, I set the frame in an animation block.
New style, I have a IBOutlet to the auto-layout constraint which determines the Y position, in this case it's distance from the bottom of the superview, and modify the constant:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

And the banner moves, exactly as expected, but no animation.

UPDATE: I re-watched WWDC 12 talk Best Practices for Mastering Auto Layout which covers animation. It discusses how to update constraints using CoreAnimation:


I've tried with the following code, but get the exact same results:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

On a side note, I have checked numerous times and this is being executed on the main thread.

How to find time complexity of an algorithm?

What have I done before posting a question on SO ?

I have gone through this, this and many other links

But no where I was able to find a clear and straight forward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.

What do I know ?

Say for a code as simple as the one below:

char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time


Say for a loop like the one below: 

for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {        
    Console.Write('Hello World !');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.
The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i &lt; N;  This will be executed N+1 times

i++ ;   This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are

{1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2

Note: This still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding on calculating time complexity

What I want to know ?

Ok, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as 

O(N), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!).... and many other, 

Can anyone help me understand how does one calculate time complexity of an algorithm? I am sure there are plenty of newbies like me wanting to know this.

85,javascript,"I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a &lt;select&gt; dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded &lt;select&gt; had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected &lt;option&gt;, because sometimes the &lt;select&gt;'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected &lt;option&gt;'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;
    }

setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);


And this worked!

I've got a solution for my problem, but I'm uneasy that I don't know exactly why this fixes my problem.  Does anyone have an official explanation?  What browser issue am I avoiding by calling my function ""later"" using setTimeout()?

File TodoReducer.js:
export default function todos(state = initialState.todo, action) {

Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.
The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

"
142,swift,"I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    for j in 0..&lt;n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

I'm sure there are some edge cases where it might be needed, but given the obscurity of it, the potential of it being redefined in future releases (my assumption based on the various definitions of it) and the reduced coding clarity - should it be avoided?  

This reminds me of overflowing (buffer overflow) of C types - pointing to the top variable and overloading to set the other field values.  It feels like sort of a techie showmanship but maintenance coder nightmare.

My fragment starts an activity for a result with the intent sent for the camera to take a picture. The picture application loads fine, takes a picture, and returns.

157,python,"I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

180,linux,"Is there a simple shell command/script that supports excluding certain files/folders from being archived?

I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.

Not quite solutions:

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

"
191,javascript,"In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:

When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS
to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the
style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript
includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before
continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering
thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the
styles it needs.

My actual testing reveals something quite different:
My test harness
I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:
require 'rubygems'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'evma_httpserver'
require 'date'

class Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection
  include EventMachine::HttpServer

  def process_http_request
    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )

    return unless @http_query_string

    path = @http_path_info
    array = @http_query_string.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;).map{|s| s.split(&quot;=&quot;)}.flatten
    parsed = Hash[*array]

    delay = parsed[&quot;delay&quot;].to_i / 1000.0
    jsdelay = parsed[&quot;jsdelay&quot;].to_i

    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)
    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)

    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0) 
    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)

    # Block which fulfills the request
    operation = proc do
      sleep delay 

      if path.match(/.js$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/javascript&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;(function(){
            var start = new Date();
            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}
          })();&quot;
      end
      if path.match(/.css$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/css&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;body {font-size: 50px;}&quot;
      end
    end

    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled
    callback = proc do |res|
        resp.send_response
    end

    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request
    EM.defer(operation, callback)
  end
end

EventMachine::run {
  EventMachine::start_server(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 8081, Handler)
  puts &quot;Listening...&quot;
}

The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.
I use the following page to test.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
          var startTime = new Date();
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elapsed time is: 
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
        document.write(new Date() - startTime);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:

When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:

I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.
What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.
Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?
It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

I managed to see the file using gitk, but it doesn't have an option to save it. I tried with command-line tools, the closest I got was:

git-show 27cf8e84bb88e24ae4b4b3df2b77aab91a3735d8 my_file.txt


However, this command shows a diff, and not the file contents. I know I can later use something like PAGER=cat and redirect output to a file, but I don't know how to get to the actual file content.

199,c#,"I have the following enumeration:

public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    FORMS = 1,
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.

I have found the following solution for this problem (link):

First I need to create a custom attribute called ""StringValue"":

public class StringValue : System.Attribute
{
    private readonly string _value;

    public StringValue(string value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {
        get { return _value; }
    }

}


Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:

public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:

public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}


Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:

string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);


Okay now all of these work like a charm but I find it a whole lot of work. I was wondering if there is a better solution for this.

I also tried something with a dictionary and static properties but that wasn't better either.

"
218,json,"First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.

Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered &quot;a set of changes&quot; and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with &quot;patch document&quot;. In my case it would be the json document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.com'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:

PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?

PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of &quot;patching&quot; or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:

What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?

I am learning C# and experimenting with different ways of saying the same thing.  

Tabs(uint t) is a function that returns a string with t amount of \t's

For example Tabs(3) returns ""\t\t\t""

Which of these three ways of implementing Tabs(uint numTabs) is best?

Of course that depends on what ""best"" means.  


The LINQ version is only two lines, which is nice.  But are the calls to Repeat and Aggregate unnecessarily time/resource consuming?
The StringBuilder version is very clear but is the StringBuilder class somehow slower?
The string version is basic, which means it is easy to understand.  
Does it not matter at all?  Are they all equal?


These are all questions to help me get a better feel for C#.   

private string Tabs(uint numTabs)
{
    IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; tabs = Enumerable.Repeat(""\t"", (int) numTabs);
    return (numTabs &gt; 0) ? tabs.Aggregate((sum, next) =&gt; sum + next) : """";

property of Foo which refers to the prototype of b and c objects.

In my case, the answer would be... all of it!

In particular, I often see notation like this in Haskell papers, but I have no clue what any of it means. I have no idea what branch of mathematics it's supposed to be.

I recognize the letters of the Greek alphabet of course and symbols such as ""∉"" (which usually means that something is not an element of a set).

On the other hand, I've never seen ""⊢"" before (Wikipedia claims it might mean ""partition""). I'm also unfamiliar with the use of the vinculum here. (Usually, it denotes a fraction, but that does not appear to be the case here.)

If somebody could at least tell me where to start looking to comprehend what this sea of symbols means, that would be helpful.

367,reactjs,"I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.

With a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).

Here's a code example:

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  handleButtonClick() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;

  }
}


Clicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.

So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?

I know about the compiler optimizations to improve speed and everything, but I don’t see many ways to further optimize my assembly solution (speaking programmatically, not mathematically).
The C++ code uses modulus every term and division every other term, while the assembly code only uses a single division every other term.
But the assembly is taking on average 1 second longer than the C++ solution. Why is this? I am asking mainly out of curiosity.

374,css,"Consider the main axis and cross axis of a flex container:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: W3C

To align flex items along the main axis there is one property:


justify-content


To align flex items along the cross axis there are three properties:


align-content
align-items
align-self


In the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. These are the default directions of a flex container.

However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the flex-direction property.

/* main axis is horizontal, cross axis is vertical */
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;

/* main axis is vertical, cross axis is horizontal */    
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;


(The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.)

My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and flex-direction makes it easy to switch back and forth. 

So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties?

Why are align-content and align-items consolidated into one property for the main axis?

Why does the main axis not get a justify-self property?



Scenarios where these properties would be useful:


placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container
#box3 { align-self: flex-end; justify-self: flex-end; }
making a group of flex items align-right (justify-content: flex-end) but have the first item align left (justify-self: flex-start)

Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With justify-self the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly (""flexes"") to different screen sizes.
in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  (justify-content: center) and align the adjacent items to the container edges (justify-self: flex-start and justify-self: flex-end). 

Note that values space-around and space-between on
justify-content property  will not keep the middle item centered about the container if the adjacent items have different widths.




#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 75px;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
}
.box3 {
  width: 200px;
}
#center {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#center &gt; span {
  background-color: aqua;
  padding: 2px;
}
&lt;div id=""center""&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;TRUE CENTER&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box1""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box2""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box3""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note that the middlebox will only be truly centered if adjacent boxes are equal width&lt;/p&gt;




jsFiddle version



As of this writing, there is no mention of justify-self or justify-items in the flexbox spec.

However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: W3C

You'll notice that justify-self and justify-items are being considered... but not for flexbox.



I'll end by reiterating the main question:


  Why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?

if (original != null)
{

Pros


Can specify which properties change
Views don't need to contain every property


Cons


2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 2 - Load original record, set changed values

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    db.Entry(original).CurrentValues.SetValues(updatedUser);
    db.SaveChanges();
}


Pros


Only modified properties are sent to database


Cons


Views need to contain every property
2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 3 - Attach updated record and set state to EntityState.Modified

Pros


1 x query on database to update


Cons

412,scala,"I have just started to look at the Scala collections library re-implementation which is coming in the imminent 2.8 release. Those familiar with the library from 2.7 will notice that the library, from a usage perspective, has changed little. For example...

&gt; List(""Paris"", ""London"").map(_.length)
res0: List[Int] List(5, 6)


...would work in either versions. The library is eminently useable: in fact it's fantastic. However, those previously unfamiliar with Scala and poking around to get a feel for the language now have to make sense of method signatures like:

def map[B, That](f: A =&gt; B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That


For such simple functionality, this is a daunting signature and one which I find myself struggling to understand. Not that I think Scala was ever likely to be the next Java (or /C/C++/C#) - I don't believe its creators were aiming it at that market - but I think it is/was certainly feasible for Scala to become the next Ruby or Python (i.e. to gain a significant commercial user-base)


Is this going to put people off coming to Scala?
Is this going to give Scala a bad name in the commercial world as an academic plaything that only dedicated PhD students can understand? Are CTOs and heads of software going to get scared off?
Was the library re-design a sensible idea?
If you're using Scala commercially, are you worried about this? Are you planning to adopt 2.8 immediately or wait to see what happens?


Steve Yegge once attacked Scala (mistakenly in my opinion) for what he saw as its overcomplicated type-system. I worry that someone is going to have a field day spreading FUD with this API (similarly to how Josh Bloch scared the JCP out of adding closures to Java).

Note - I should be clear that, whilst I believe that Joshua Bloch was influential in the rejection of the BGGA closures proposal, I don't ascribe this to anything other than his honestly-held beliefs that the proposal represented a mistake.



Despite whatever my wife and coworkers keep telling me, I don't think I'm an idiot: I have a good degree in mathematics from the University of Oxford, and I've been programming commercially for almost 12 years and in Scala for about a year (also commercially).

417,java,"In Hidden Features of Java the top answer mentions Double Brace Initialization, with a very enticing syntax:

Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};


This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  

Main question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)

Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  

Third question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code?

Summary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  

On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  

Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.

Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!

7/2017: Baeldung has a good summary of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.

12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:

Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = Set.of(""vanilla"", ""strawberry"", ""chocolate"", ""butter pecan"");


That's for sure the way to go.  If you're stuck with an earlier version, take a look at Google Collections' ImmutableSet.

Would their git pull still work or would it throw an error that it couldn't find origin/master anymore?

Then, further on, I want to create a new master branch (both locally and remote). Again, after I did this, what would happen now if the other users do git pull?

I guess all this would result in a lot of trouble. Is there a clean way to get what I want? Or should I just leave master as it is and create a new branch master-new and just work there further on?

464,typescript,"When looking at the sourcecode for a tslint rule, I came across the following statement:

if (node.parent!.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.ObjectLiteralExpression) {
    return;
}


Notice the ! operator after node.parent. Interesting!

I first tried compiling the file locally with my currently installed version of TS (1.5.3). The resulting error pointed to the exact location of the bang:

$ tsc --noImplicitAny memberAccessRule.ts 
noPublicModifierRule.ts(57,24): error TS1005: ')' expected.


Next I upgraded to the latest TS (2.1.6), which compiled it without issue. So it seems to be feature of TS 2.x. But the transpilation ignored the bang completely, resulting in the following JS:

if (node.parent.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.ObjectLiteralExpression) {
    return;
}


My Google fu has thus far failed me.

--exclude=PATTERN     Recurse in directories skip file matching PATTERN.

Searching on grep include, grep include exclude, grep exclude and variants did not find anything relevant
If there's a better way of grepping only in certain files, I'm all for it; moving the offending files is not an option.

492,git,"Ok, after seeing this post by PJ Hyett, I have decided to skip to the end and go with Git.

So what I need is a beginner's practical guide to Git.  ""Beginner"" being defined as someone who knows how to handle their compiler, understands to some level what a Makefile is, and has touched source control without understanding it very well.

""Practical"" being defined as this person doesn't want to get into great detail regarding what Git is doing in the background, and doesn't even care (or know) that it's distributed.  Your answers might hint at the possibilities, but try to aim for the beginner that wants to keep a 'main' repository on a 'server' which is backed up and secure, and treat their local repository as merely a 'client' resource.

So:

Installation/Setup


How to install Git
How do you set up Git?  Try to cover Linux, Windows, Mac, think 'client/server' mindset.


Setup GIT Server with Msysgit on Windows

How do you create a new project/repository?
How do you configure it to ignore files (.obj, .user, etc) that are not really part of the codebase?


Working with the code


How do you get the latest code?
How do you check out code?
How do you commit changes?
How do you see what's uncommitted, or the status of your current codebase?
How do you destroy unwanted commits?
How do you compare two revisions of a file, or your current file and a previous revision?
How do you see the history of revisions to a file?
How do you handle binary files (visio docs, for instance, or compiler environments)?
How do you merge files changed at the ""same time""?
How do you undo (revert or reset) a commit?


Tagging, branching, releases, baselines


How do you 'mark' 'tag' or 'release' a particular set of revisions for a particular set of files so you can always pull that one later?
How do you pull a particular 'release'?
How do you branch?
How do you merge branches?
How do you resolve conflicts and complete the merge?
How do you merge parts of one branch into another branch?
What is rebasing?
How do I track remote branches?
How can I create a branch on a remote repository?
How do I delete a branch on a remote repository?

495,sql,"I'll use a concrete, but hypothetical, example.

Each Order normally has only one line item:

Orders:

OrderGUID   OrderNumber
=========   ============
{FFB2...}   STL-7442-1      
{3EC6...}   MPT-9931-8A


LineItems:

LineItemGUID   Order ID Quantity   Description
============   ======== ========   =================================

{1609B09...}   2        32         spurving bearing


But occasionally there will be an order with two line items:

LineItemID   Order ID    Quantity   Description
==========   ========    ========   =================================
{A58A1...}   6,784,329   5          pentametric fan
{0E9BC...}   6,784,329   5          differential girdlespring 


Normally when showing the orders to the user:



SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN LineItems 
    ON Orders.OrderID = LineItems.OrderID


I want to show the single item on the order. But with this occasional order containing two (or more) items, the orders would appear be duplicated:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         spurving bearing
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan
KSG-0619-81   5          differential girdlespring


What I really want is to have SQL Server just pick one, as it will be good enough:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         differential girdlespring
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan


If I get adventurous, I might show the user, an ellipsis to indicate that there's more than one:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         differential girdlespring
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan, ...


So the question is how to either


eliminate ""duplicate"" rows
only join to one of the rows, to avoid duplication


First attempt

My first naive attempt was to only join to the ""TOP 1"" line items:

SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN (
       SELECT TOP 1 LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
       FROM LineItems
       WHERE LineItems.OrderID = Orders.OrderID) LineItems2
    ON 1=1


But that gives the error:


  The column or prefix 'Orders' does not
  match with a table name or alias name
  used in the query.  


Presumably because the inner select doesn't see the outer table.

Question is: are there any caveats in using the second way? Any performance difference? Am I missing the Pythonic Way™ entirely and should do it in yet another way (such as using itemgetter instead of the lambda)?

Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.
The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

42,swift,"I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..&lt;n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..&lt;n {
    for j in 0..&lt;n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

57,python,"I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

80,linux,"Is there a simple shell command/script that supports excluding certain files/folders from being archived?

I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.

Not quite solutions:

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup

I've seen a few cases on StackOverflow where auto resizing was needed, but they are either very special cases with hack solutions, have no solution, or involve re-drawing the TextView recursively until it is small enough (which is memory intense and forces the user to watch the text shrink step-by-step with every recursion). 

But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found.

"
91,javascript,"In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:

When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS
to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the
style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript
includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before
continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering
thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the
styles it needs.

My actual testing reveals something quite different:
My test harness
I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:
require 'rubygems'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'evma_httpserver'
require 'date'

class Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection
  include EventMachine::HttpServer

  def process_http_request
    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )

    return unless @http_query_string

    path = @http_path_info
    array = @http_query_string.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;).map{|s| s.split(&quot;=&quot;)}.flatten
    parsed = Hash[*array]

    delay = parsed[&quot;delay&quot;].to_i / 1000.0
    jsdelay = parsed[&quot;jsdelay&quot;].to_i

    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)
    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)

    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0) 
    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)

    # Block which fulfills the request
    operation = proc do
      sleep delay 

      if path.match(/.js$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/javascript&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;(function(){
            var start = new Date();
            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}
          })();&quot;
      end
      if path.match(/.css$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/css&quot;
        resp.content = &quot;body {font-size: 50px;}&quot;
      end
    end

    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled
    callback = proc do |res|
        resp.send_response
    end

    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request
    EM.defer(operation, callback)
  end
end

EventMachine::run {
  EventMachine::start_server(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 8081, Handler)
  puts &quot;Listening...&quot;
}

The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.
I use the following page to test.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
          var startTime = new Date();
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elapsed time is: 
      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
        document.write(new Date() - startTime);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:

When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:

I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.
What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.
Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?
It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.

I have found the following solution for this problem (link):

First I need to create a custom attribute called ""StringValue"":

public class StringValue : System.Attribute
{
    private readonly string _value;

    public StringValue(string value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {
        get { return _value; }
    }

}


Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:

public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:

public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}


Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:

string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);


Okay now all of these work like a charm but I find it a whole lot of work. I was wondering if there is a better solution for this.

I also tried something with a dictionary and static properties but that wasn't better either.

"
118,json,"First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.

Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.com'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered &quot;a set of changes&quot; and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with &quot;patch document&quot;. In my case it would be the json document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.com'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:

PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?

PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of &quot;patching&quot; or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:

What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?

130,maven,"What is the difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies?
I have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.
It seems that a dependency defined under the dependencyManagement can be used in its child modules without specifying the version. 

For example:

A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the dependencyManagement:

&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;3.8&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
 &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;


Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit:

  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
 &lt;/dependencies&gt;


However, I wonder if it is necessary to define junit in the parent pom? Why not define it directly in the needed module?

   if [ -d /usr/share/MyApplicationName ]; then

My first query is about the line:

set -e


I think that the rest of the script is pretty simple: It checks whether the Debian/Ubuntu package manager is executing an install operation. If it is, it checks whether my application has just been installed on the system. If it has, the script prints the message ""MyApplicationName is just installed"" and ends (return 1 mean that ends with an “error”, doesn’t it?).

The StringBuilder version is very clear but is the StringBuilder class somehow slower?

More so, I don't want to modify the history really. If there was bad code, it was there in the history and can be seen. I just want it out in the working copy, and I don't mind a reverse merge commit.

In other words, what is the Git equivalent of the following svn commands:

svn merge -r 303:295 http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk


which removes all changes from 295 to 302 by reverse merging all changes in those revisions, as a new commit.

svn merge -c -302 ^/trunk


which undoes the 302 commit, of course by adding another commit that reverse merges the changes from that respective commit.

I thought it should be a fairly simple operation in Git and a fairly common use case. What else is the point of atomic commits? 

We have staging stashing and all to ensure the commits are perfectly atomic, shouldn't you be able to undo one or more of those atomic commits easily?

267,reactjs,"I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.

With a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).

Here's a code example:

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  handleButtonClick() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        {Math.random()}
        &lt;button onClick={this.handleButtonClick.bind(this)}&gt;
          Click me
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}


Clicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.

So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?

I know about the compiler optimizations to improve speed and everything, but I don’t see many ways to further optimize my assembly solution (speaking programmatically, not mathematically).
The C++ code uses modulus every term and division every other term, while the assembly code only uses a single division every other term.
But the assembly is taking on average 1 second longer than the C++ solution. Why is this? I am asking mainly out of curiosity.

274,css,"Consider the main axis and cross axis of a flex container:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: W3C

To align flex items along the main axis there is one property:


justify-content


To align flex items along the cross axis there are three properties:


align-content
align-items
align-self


In the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. These are the default directions of a flex container.

However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the flex-direction property.

/* main axis is horizontal, cross axis is vertical */
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;

/* main axis is vertical, cross axis is horizontal */    
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;


(The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.)

My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and flex-direction makes it easy to switch back and forth. 

So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties?

Why are align-content and align-items consolidated into one property for the main axis?

Why does the main axis not get a justify-self property?



Scenarios where these properties would be useful:


placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container
#box3 { align-self: flex-end; justify-self: flex-end; }
making a group of flex items align-right (justify-content: flex-end) but have the first item align left (justify-self: flex-start)

Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With justify-self the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly (""flexes"") to different screen sizes.
in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  (justify-content: center) and align the adjacent items to the container edges (justify-self: flex-start and justify-self: flex-end). 

Note that values space-around and space-between on
justify-content property  will not keep the middle item centered about the container if the adjacent items have different widths.




#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 75px;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
}
.box3 {
  width: 200px;
}
#center {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#center &gt; span {
  background-color: aqua;
  padding: 2px;
}
&lt;div id=""center""&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;TRUE CENTER&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box1""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box2""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""box box3""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note that the middlebox will only be truly centered if adjacent boxes are equal width&lt;/p&gt;




jsFiddle version



As of this writing, there is no mention of justify-self or justify-items in the flexbox spec.

However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: W3C

You'll notice that justify-self and justify-items are being considered... but not for flexbox.



I'll end by reiterating the main question:


  Why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?

There seem to be numerous methods of fixing the clear bug in Firefox:


&lt;br clear=""all""/&gt;
overflow:auto
overflow:hidden


In my situation, the only one that seems to work correctly is the &lt;br clear=""all""/&gt; solution, which is a little bit scruffy. overflow:auto gives me nasty scrollbars, and overflow:hidden must surely have side effects.
Also, IE7 apparently shouldn't suffer from this problem due to its incorrect behaviour, but in my situation it's suffering the same as Firefox.

291,c#,"I have been exploring different methods of editing/updating a record within Entity Framework 5 in an ASP.NET MVC3 environment, but so far none of them tick all of the boxes I need. I'll explain why.

I have found three methods to which I'll mention the pros and cons:

Method 1 - Load original record, update each property

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    original.BusinessEntityId = updatedUser.BusinessEntityId;
    original.Email = updatedUser.Email;
    original.EmployeeId = updatedUser.EmployeeId;
    original.Forename = updatedUser.Forename;
    original.Surname = updatedUser.Surname;
    original.Telephone = updatedUser.Telephone;
    original.Title = updatedUser.Title;
    original.Fax = updatedUser.Fax;
    original.ASPNetUserId = updatedUser.ASPNetUserId;
    db.SaveChanges();
}    


Pros


Can specify which properties change
Views don't need to contain every property


Cons


2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 2 - Load original record, set changed values

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    db.Entry(original).CurrentValues.SetValues(updatedUser);
    db.SaveChanges();
}


Pros


Only modified properties are sent to database


Cons


Views need to contain every property
2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 3 - Attach updated record and set state to EntityState.Modified

db.Users.Attach(updatedUser);
db.Entry(updatedUser).State = EntityState.Modified;
db.SaveChanges();


Pros


1 x query on database to update


Cons


Can't specify which properties change
Views must contain every property

My question to you guys; is there a clean way that I can achieve this set of goals?


Can specify which properties change

312,scala,"I have just started to look at the Scala collections library re-implementation which is coming in the imminent 2.8 release. Those familiar with the library from 2.7 will notice that the library, from a usage perspective, has changed little. For example...

&gt; List(""Paris"", ""London"").map(_.length)
res0: List[Int] List(5, 6)


...would work in either versions. The library is eminently useable: in fact it's fantastic. However, those previously unfamiliar with Scala and poking around to get a feel for the language now have to make sense of method signatures like:

def map[B, That](f: A =&gt; B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That


For such simple functionality, this is a daunting signature and one which I find myself struggling to understand. Not that I think Scala was ever likely to be the next Java (or /C/C++/C#) - I don't believe its creators were aiming it at that market - but I think it is/was certainly feasible for Scala to become the next Ruby or Python (i.e. to gain a significant commercial user-base)


Is this going to put people off coming to Scala?
Is this going to give Scala a bad name in the commercial world as an academic plaything that only dedicated PhD students can understand? Are CTOs and heads of software going to get scared off?
Was the library re-design a sensible idea?
If you're using Scala commercially, are you worried about this? Are you planning to adopt 2.8 immediately or wait to see what happens?


Steve Yegge once attacked Scala (mistakenly in my opinion) for what he saw as its overcomplicated type-system. I worry that someone is going to have a field day spreading FUD with this API (similarly to how Josh Bloch scared the JCP out of adding closures to Java).

Note - I should be clear that, whilst I believe that Joshua Bloch was influential in the rejection of the BGGA closures proposal, I don't ascribe this to anything other than his honestly-held beliefs that the proposal represented a mistake.



Despite whatever my wife and coworkers keep telling me, I don't think I'm an idiot: I have a good degree in mathematics from the University of Oxford, and I've been programming commercially for almost 12 years and in Scala for about a year (also commercially).

317,java,"In Hidden Features of Java the top answer mentions Double Brace Initialization, with a very enticing syntax:

Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};


This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  

Main question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)

Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  

Third question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code?

Summary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  

On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  

Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.

Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!

7/2017: Baeldung has a good summary of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.

12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:

Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = Set.of(""vanilla"", ""strawberry"", ""chocolate"", ""butter pecan"");


That's for sure the way to go.  If you're stuck with an earlier version, take a look at Google Collections' ImmutableSet.

I'll also link to the entries from the bullet list above so it's easy to find them later.

395,sql,"I'll use a concrete, but hypothetical, example.

Each Order normally has only one line item:

Orders:

OrderGUID   OrderNumber
=========   ============
{FFB2...}   STL-7442-1      
{3EC6...}   MPT-9931-8A


LineItems:

LineItemGUID   Order ID Quantity   Description
============   ======== ========   =================================
{098FBE3...}   1        7          prefabulated amulite
{1609B09...}   2        32         spurving bearing


But occasionally there will be an order with two line items:

LineItemID   Order ID    Quantity   Description
==========   ========    ========   =================================
{A58A1...}   6,784,329   5          pentametric fan
{0E9BC...}   6,784,329   5          differential girdlespring 


Normally when showing the orders to the user:



SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN LineItems 
    ON Orders.OrderID = LineItems.OrderID


I want to show the single item on the order. But with this occasional order containing two (or more) items, the orders would appear be duplicated:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         spurving bearing
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan
KSG-0619-81   5          differential girdlespring


What I really want is to have SQL Server just pick one, as it will be good enough:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         differential girdlespring
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan


If I get adventurous, I might show the user, an ellipsis to indicate that there's more than one:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         differential girdlespring
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan, ...


So the question is how to either


eliminate ""duplicate"" rows
only join to one of the rows, to avoid duplication


First attempt

My first naive attempt was to only join to the ""TOP 1"" line items:

SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN (
       SELECT TOP 1 LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
       FROM LineItems
       WHERE LineItems.OrderID = Orders.OrderID) LineItems2
    ON 1=1


But that gives the error:


  The column or prefix 'Orders' does not
  match with a table name or alias name
  used in the query.  


Presumably because the inner select doesn't see the outer table.

By ""proper"" I mean that if my parent element is 200px tall and I specify height = 100% with padding = 5px I would expect that I should get a 190px high element with border = 5px on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element.

Now, I know that that's not how the standard box model specifies it should work (although I'd like to know why, exactly...), so the obvious answer doesn't work:

#myDiv {
    width: 100%
    height: 100%;
    padding: 5px;

The app I'm working on isn't really a location app per se, but it does need to get the user's location in order to display a list of nearby businesses.  It doesn't need to worry about if the user is moving around or anything like that.

Here's what I'd like to do:


Show the user a list of nearby locations.
Preload the user's location so that by the time I need it in Activity X, it will be available.
I don't particularly care about accuracy or frequency of update. Just grabbing one location is sufficient as long as it's not way off. Maybe if I want to be fancy I'll update the location once every few mins or so, but it's not a huge priority.
Work for any device as long as it has either a GPS or a Network Location provider.


It seems like it shouldn't be that hard, but it appears to me that I have to spin up two different location providers (GPS and NETWORK) and manage each's lifecycle. Not only that, but I have to duplicate the same code in multiple activities to satisfy #2. I've tried using getBestProvider() in the past to cut the solution down to just using one location provider, but that seems to only give you the best ""theoretical"" provider rather than the provider that's actually going to give you the best results.

Is there a simpler way to accomplish this?

My question is simply What's the usual way of actually running the tests? I suspect this is obvious to everyone except me, but you can't just run python test_antigravity.py from the test directory as its import antigravity will fail as the module is not on the path.

I know I could modify PYTHONPATH and other search path related tricks, but I can't believe that's the simplest way - it's fine if you're the developer but not realistic to expect your users to use if they just want to check the tests are passing.

The other alternative is just to copy the test file into the other directory, but it seems a bit dumb and misses the point of having them in a separate directory to start with.

439,android,"I know that Activities are designed to represent a single screen of my application, while Fragments are designed to be reusable UI layouts with logic embedded inside of them.
Until not long ago, I developed an application as it said that they should be developed.
I created an Activity to represent a screen of my application and used Fragments for ViewPager or Google Maps. I rarely created a ListFragment or other UI that can be reused several times.
Recently I stumbled on a project that contains only 2 Activities one is a SettingsActivity and other one is the MainActivity. The layout of the MainActivity is populated with many hidden full screen UI fragments and only one is shown. In the Activity logic there are many FragmentTransitions between the different screens of the application.
What I like about this approach is that because the application uses an ActionBar, it stays intact and does not move with the screen switching animation, which is what happens with Activity switching. This give a more fluent feel to those screen transitions.
So I guess what I'm asking is to share your current development manner regarding this topic, I know it might look like an opinion based question at first look but I look at it as an Android design and architecture question... Not really an opinion based one.
UPDATE (01.05.2014): Following this presentation by Eric Burke from Square, (which I have to say is a great presentation with a lot of useful tools for android developers. And I am not related in any way to Square)
http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Android-Design/
From my personal experience over the past few months, I found that the best way to construct my applications is to create groups of fragments that come to represent a flow in the application and present all those fragments in one Activity. So basically you will have the same number of Activities in your application as the number of flows.
That way the action bar stays intact on all the flow's screens, but is being recreated on changing a flow which makes a lot of sense. As Eric Burke states and as I have come to realize as well, the philosophy of using as few Activities as possible is not applicable for all situations because it creates a mess in what he calls the &quot;God&quot; activity.

To be honest I don't know how to check the content of the validation errors. Visual Studio shows me that it's an array with 8 objects, so 8 validation errors.

I had an enum called Status, I changed it to a class called Status

I understand that this is because I am trying to fetch that data from within my localhost and the solution should be using CORS. Now I thought I actually did that, but somehow it either ignores what I write in the header or the problem is something else? 

So, is there an implementation issue? Am I doing it wrong? I can't check the server logs unfortunately. I'm really a bit stuck here.

git add README

git commit -a -m 'To add new line to readme'

I didn't push the code to GitHub. Now I want to cancel this commit.
For this, I used
git reset --hard HEAD~1

But I lost the newly added line 'this for my testing line' from the README file.
This should not happen. I need the content to be there. Is there a way to retain the content and cancel my local commit?

"
485,r,"Overview

I'm relatively familiar with data.table, not so much with dplyr.  I've read through some dplyr vignettes and examples that have popped up on SO, and so far my conclusions are that:


data.table and dplyr are comparable in speed, except when there are many (i.e. >10-100K) groups, and in some other circumstances (see benchmarks below)
dplyr has more accessible syntax
dplyr abstracts (or will) potential DB interactions
There are some minor functionality differences (see ""Examples/Usage"" below)


In my mind 2. doesn't bear much weight because I am fairly familiar with it data.table, though I understand that for users new to both it will be a big factor.  I would like to avoid an argument about which is more intuitive, as that is irrelevant for my specific question asked from the perspective of someone already familiar with data.table.  I also would like to avoid a discussion about how ""more intuitive"" leads to faster analysis (certainly true, but again, not what I'm most interested about here).

Question

What I want to know is:


Are there analytical tasks that are a lot easier to code with one or the other package for people familiar with the packages (i.e. some combination of keystrokes required vs. required level of esotericism, where less of each is a good thing).
Are there analytical tasks that are performed substantially (i.e. more than 2x) more efficiently in one package vs. another.


One recent SO question got me thinking about this a bit more, because up until that point I didn't think dplyr would offer much beyond what I can already do in data.table.  Here is the dplyr solution (data at end of Q):

dat %.%
  group_by(name, job) %.%
  filter(job != ""Boss"" | year == min(year)) %.%
  mutate(cumu_job2 = cumsum(job2))


Which was much better than my hack attempt at a data.table solution.  That said, good data.table solutions are also pretty good (thanks Jean-Robert, Arun, and note here I favored single statement over the strictly most optimal solution):

setDT(dat)[,
  .SD[job != ""Boss"" | year == min(year)][, cumjob := cumsum(job2)], 
  by=list(id, job)
]


The syntax for the latter may seem very esoteric, but it actually is pretty straightforward if you're used to data.table (i.e. doesn't use some of the more esoteric tricks).

Ideally what I'd like to see is some good examples were the dplyr or data.table way is substantially more concise or performs substantially better.

Examples

Usage


dplyr does not allow grouped operations that return arbitrary number of rows (from eddi's question, note: this looks like it will be implemented in dplyr 0.5, also, @beginneR shows a potential work-around using do in the answer to @eddi's question).
data.table supports rolling joins (thanks @dholstius) as well as overlap joins
data.table internally optimises expressions of the form DT[col == value] or DT[col %in% values] for speed through automatic indexing which uses binary search while using the same base R syntax. See here for some more details and a tiny benchmark.
dplyr offers standard evaluation versions of functions (e.g. regroup, summarize_each_) that can simplify the programmatic use of dplyr (note programmatic use of data.table is definitely possible, just requires some careful thought, substitution/quoting, etc, at least to my knowledge)


Benchmarks


I ran my own benchmarks and found both packages to be comparable in ""split apply combine"" style analysis, except when there are very large numbers of groups (>100K) at which point data.table becomes substantially faster.
@Arun ran some benchmarks on joins, showing that data.table scales better than dplyr as the number of groups increase (updated with recent enhancements in both packages and recent version of R).  Also, a benchmark when trying to get unique values has data.table ~6x faster.
(Unverified) has data.table 75% faster on larger versions of a group/apply/sort while dplyr was 40% faster on the smaller ones (another SO question from comments, thanks danas).
Matt, the main author of data.table, has benchmarked grouping operations on data.table, dplyr and python pandas on up to 2 billion rows (~100GB in RAM).
An older benchmark on 80K groups has data.table ~8x faster


Data

This is for the first example I showed in the question section.

2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), name = c(""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Jane"", 
""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Bob"", ""Bob"", ""Bob"", ""Bob"", ""Bob"", 
""Bob"", ""Bob"", ""Bob""), year = c(1980L, 1981L, 1982L, 1983L, 1984L,

487,java,"I'm a bit confused about how Java generics handle inheritance / polymorphism.

Assume the following hierarchy -

Animal (Parent)

Dog - Cat (Children)

So suppose I have a method doSomething(List&lt;Animal&gt; animals). By all the rules of inheritance and polymorphism, I would assume that a List&lt;Dog&gt; is a List&lt;Animal&gt; and a List&lt;Cat&gt; is a List&lt;Animal&gt; - and so either one could be passed to this method. Not so. If I want to achieve this behavior, I have to explicitly tell the method to accept a list of any subclass of Animal by saying doSomething(List&lt;? extends Animal&gt; animals). 

I understand that this is Java's behavior. My question is why? Why is polymorphism generally implicit, but when it comes to generics it must be specified?
